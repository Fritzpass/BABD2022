Oh pity us here we angels of lead
We're dead, we're sick hanging by thread
Get real
Get real
You can't stop meaningful teenage cries
From deep behind fifty year old eyes
Get real
Get real
I'm scared to touch
Too tense to be undone
I walk the streets
Not expecting morning sun
Against the voice of doom
Failures fall all over town
I guess I should, I feel I should
Get real
Get real
What's up?
What happened when I wasn't around?
Who did what?
What went down?
Get real
Get real
Think about myself it happens to me
It happens in the tunnel when I let myself feel
Get real
Get real
I feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town
I feel I should, I guess I should
Get real
Get real
Get real
Get real
The dazzle of light
The rape of life
The seed, the curse
The jazz of life
Get real
Get real
Get real
Get real

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you
This chaos is killing me
So bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
Bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
This chaos is killing me
Hallo spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you
And the chaos is killing me
Yeah, bye bye, love
So, bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
So, bye bye, love
This chaos is killing me
This chaos is killing me
Yeah, bye bye, love
Bye bye, love
Good time, love
Be sweet, sweet dove
Bye bye, spaceboy
Bye bye, love
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you

Baby Grace is the victim
She was 14 years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning
For the finger points at me
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
No, I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies
And the prison priests are decent
My attorney seems sincere
I fear my days are numbered
Lord, get me out of here
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies
This is your shadow on my wall
This is my flesh and blood
This is what I could've been
And the wheels are turning and turning
As the twentieth century dies
If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If I'd only paid my bill
(All's well)
I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies
This is my bunk with two sheets
This is my food though foul
This is what I could have been
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies
All's well
Twentieth century dies
All's well
All's well
All's well
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies

Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond
Cruise me, babe
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond
No return
No return
I'm deranged
I'm deranged down down down
I'm deranged down down down
So cruise me babe, cruise me babe beyond
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me, baby
The clutch of life and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me, babe
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in

Stay away from the future
Back away from the light
It's all deranged
No control
Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkened shore would not bother me
If I can't control the web we weave
My life will be lost in fallen leaves
Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
I shall live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've gotta have a scheme, you've gotta have a plan
In the world of today for tomorrow's man
No control
Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
Forbidden words deafen me
In memory, no control
See how far a sinful man
Burned his tracks, his bloody robes
You've gotta have a scheme, you gotta have a plan
In the world of today for tomorrow's man
I shall live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
No control
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
Deranged
Deranged

Now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow
It happens today
The damage today
They fall on today
They beat on the outside
And I'll stand by you
Now
Not tomorrow
It's happening now
Not tomorrow
It's happening now
The crazed in the hot-zone
The mental and diva's hands
The feasting of life
To the music outside
To the music outside
It happens outside
The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
It's happening, now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow
The music is outside
It's happening outside

My name is Mr. Touchshriek 
Of Touchshriek mail order and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and empty females
I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop 
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide intellect
He's a broken man
I'm also a broken man
It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric
Some of the houses around here still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing
If I had another broken man
Oh, I dream of something like that

Test, testing, testing
This, and, Grace is my name 
And, and I was, umm
It was that phot... a fading photograph of 
A patch, patchwork quilt
And they've put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs 
So I'm thinking very, too, bit too fast like a brain patch
And ah they won't let me see anybody
If, if I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop, popular musics 
And aftershocks 
I've been watching a television of, ah, in the homelands
That's the new homelands 
And um, and that's all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horrid

Ramona is so cold
When she broke it off with Leon, she said
"The ring is enough,
I don't wanna see this face again."
Ramona was so cold
Ramona was so cold

Old Touchschriek was the main nameserver
Suspected of being a shoulder surfer
But he didn't know from shit
About challenge response systems
Now Ramona A. Stone, we knew was selling interest drugs
She got males all hung up on her mind filters
She was if you don't mind me saying so an update demon
Now Leon
He couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight
He jumps up on the stage with a criss criss machete
And slashes around cutting a zero on everything
I mean a zero in the fabric of time itself
Was this a suspect?
I says to myself
"Woah! Quelle courage!"
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself
Let me take you back to when it all began

I was Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste in a tunnel
But I've been having a mid-life crisis
And I've been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny coloured English
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name, I am with name
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
She should say: twitch & stream
It'll end in chrome
Night of the female good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
She should say:
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millennium fetish
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
I am with name
Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
I am Ramona A. Stone
Give it to me one more time
Anxiety descending
Anxiety descending

You, you, you
You, you, you
All our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun
No peachy prayers
No trendy rechauff√©
I'm with you
So I can't go on
All my violence
Raining tears upon the sheet
I'm bewildered
For we're strangers when we meet
Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you
Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes
All my violence
Raining tears upon the sheet
I'm resentful
For we're strangers when we meet
Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new
Your embrace
Was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu
Steely resolve
Is falling from me
My poor soul
All bruised passivity
All your regrets
Ride rough-shod over me
I'm so glad
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover
For we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over
But we're strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet

For we're living in a safety zone
Don't be holding back from me
We're living from hour to hour down here
And we'll take it when we can
It's a kind of living which recognizes
The death of the odorless man
When nothing is vanity, nothing's too slow
It's not Eden but it's no sham
There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And it's lights up, boys
Lights up, boys
Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While we're swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man
And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And the silence flies on its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives
And there's no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you
I don't know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding you

Turn, and turn again
Turn, and turn again
I shake and stare the sun
Till my eyes burn
I shake at the mothers
Brutal vermin
I shake and stare
At the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober philistine
Turn, and turn again
Worm, the pain and blade
Turn, and turn again
The screw
Is a tightening atrocity
I shake
For the reeking flesh is as romantic as hell
The need
To have seen it all
The voyeur
Of utter destruction as beauty
I shake
Turn, and turn again
I shake
Turn, and turn again
I shake
I shake
I shake

Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson
His delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds
It's difficult you see
To give up, baby
To leave a job
When you know the money's from day to day
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes
Cold winter bleeds on the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand
Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson
His delay just wasting my time
It's difficult, you see
To give up, baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes
It's difficult, you see
It's difficult, you see
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes

White boys falling on the fires of night
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
I'd rather be inside you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you
You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
Mama can I kiss you? daddy can I kiss? (no)
(I wish you well) Innocence passed me by
Wanna be screwing when the nightmare comes
(I wish you well, I wish you well)
Wanna come quick and die
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you
You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
(Shoes, shoes, little white shoes)
Where have all the flowers gone?
All the little fragile champion boys
(Toys, toys, little black toys)
Dripping on the end of a gun
Even if you disagree
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you
You show respect, even if you disagree

You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
(Even if you disagree, even if you disagree)
Toys, toys, little black toys
Wish you well, wish you well
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you well

Cruising around me, the flames burn my body
Wishful beginnings
Does this remind them again and again
You're a sorry little girl
You're a sorry little girl
Please hide
For the pain must feel like snow
You're a sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
Please hide
From the kiss and the bite
Shame burns
Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in, only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
I'm no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
I'm sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
Cover me, cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down
We had such wishful beginnings
But we lived unbearable lives
I'm sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
So so sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
There you go

Friends say it's fine 
Friends say it's good 
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood 
I walk like a rat
Crawl like a cat
Sting like a bee 
Babe I'm gonna be your man
And it's plain to see 
You were meant for me 
Yeah, I'm your toy 
Your 20th Century boy 
Friends say it's fine 
Friends say it's good 
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood

I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known
A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.

Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25
Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude 
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
Now Jimmy's looking sweet though he dresses like a queen
He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love
We can love
And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag
Too many snags
Well, I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude
All the young dudes

Every chance
Every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
I was always looking
Left and right
Always crashing in the same car
Jasmine, I saw you peeping
As I put my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to ninety-four
But I'm always crashing in the same car

He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back 
In Atlantic City
There's not even a demon 
In Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise 
As I walk down the aisle?
And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone 
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Two young men 
Dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad-tempered child 
On a rain slicked street
And I'm gone gone gone
And I'm older than movies
Oh, let me dance, babe
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone
Through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame
(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(Get me some, fame)
(Now get-ah, fame)

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Just for one day

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear my crown of shit
On my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stain of time
The feeling disappears
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

I can't read and I can't write down
I don't know a book from countdown
I don't care which shadow gets me
All I've got is someone's face
Money goes to money heaven
Bodies go to body hell
I just cough, catch the chase
Switch the channel watch the police car
I can't read shit anymore
I just sit back and ignore
'Cause I just can't get it right, can't get it right
I can't read shit I can't read shit
Oh
When you see a famous smile
No matter where you run your mile
To be right in that photograph
Andy where's my fifteen minutes
I said
Yeah
I can't read shit anymore
I just can't read shit anymore
No matter I just can't get it right
I can't reach it
I can't reach it
No
No
Uh
Uh
Uh

She had an horror of rooms she was tired you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again
She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies
She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet
Dead roses
Saki and strings divine
You'll make it
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war
Don't fake it
Sadden glissando strings
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell
I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
(See the lights all shining bright on Broadway)

I've seen all the rest of my Hollywood highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff from my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty, 'cause you just got paid
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel 
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head 
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
Please stay
You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since you pinned your baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions, a sack full of cheques
You made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
For a day
Oh yeah
Don't you care?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo!
Oh yeah

Let me put my arms around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh, babe, it'll be all right
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fallout saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
That stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Where once had raged a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday, yeah
Yeah
Drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
Drive, drive-in Saturday (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a drive-in Saturday, yeah (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
(It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)

She'll come, she'll go.
She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul
Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta
And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast.
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She'll come, she'll go.
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become
Her point of view
And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast.
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end (repeat)

Ooh
He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions, they followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Putting on some clothes, I made my way to school
I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights
Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table, a gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit, he'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust," I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Ow

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace, child
I moved up to take a place
Near you
So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart
In pieces
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day, though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
Prettiest star
One day, though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star

Time, he's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy
Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy
Time, in Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think 
Oh God I'm still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed, your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, time!

Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old-fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so
Yeah! It was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! So it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking, the manholes were smoking
Every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played a Tiger Rag
And the villains on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! And I ran to the street, looking for information
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man

I wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me
But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown
And I'm still so afraid
Yes, I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid on my own
On my own
What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds
If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile
Then I won't feel afraid
No, I won't feel afraid
I won't be, be afraid
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25
Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude 
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
Now Jimmy's looking sweet though he dresses like a queen
He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love
We can love
And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag
Too many snags
Well, I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes

My, my, the time do fly
When it's in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For I've never been a winner in my life
I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh, it's the animal in me
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand
And I'll walk you through the doors
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
My, my, but time do fly
When it's in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For I've never been a sinner, la di da
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?
I miss your kissin' and I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
Just run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet and send it to me
I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you di yi yi yi yine
D -A -V -I -D
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
So bloody your hands on the cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame
(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(Get me some, fame)
(Now get-ah, fame)

In the event that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion and we never get old
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable, too.
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
It's a very modern world, but nobody is perfect
It's a moving world, but that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we?
And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember it's true, a loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable, too.
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
But any sudden movement, and I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you
This chaos is killing me
So bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
Bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
This chaos is killing me
Hallo spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you
And the chaos is killing me
Yeah, bye bye, love
So, bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
So, bye bye, love
This chaos is killing me
This chaos is killing me
Yeah, bye bye, love
Bye bye, love
Good time, love
Be sweet, sweet dove
Bye bye, spaceboy
Bye bye, love
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

See the great white scar
Over Battery park
Then a flare glides over
But I won't look at that scar
Oh, my nuclear baby
Oh, my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
Let's face the music and dance
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) A new killer star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) The stars in your eyes
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in color
First a horseback bomber
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on dateline
Let's face the music and dance
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) A new killer star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) The stars in your eyes
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)

- Lyrics and music by David Bowie 
Tragic youth was looking young and sexy
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief
The tragic youth was going down on me
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
I built a wall of sound to separate us
And hid among the junk of wretched highs
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Ha ha ha ha
Whoo hoo
Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight
Da da da da da da da da da
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da da da da da da da da da
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
Woo hoo
I still don't remember how this happened
I still don't get the wherefores and the whys
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
Hey boy welcome to reality
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
I've been right and I've been wrong
Now I'm back where I started from
Never looked over reality's shoulder
Ha ha ha ha
Huh ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Huh ha ha
Wooh
Woo hoo
Wooh

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
Uh
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

Calling sister midnight
You've got me reaching for the moon
Calling sister midnight
You've got me playing the fool
Calling sister midnight
Calling sister midnight
Can you hear me call?
Can you hear me well?
Can you hear me at all?
Calling sister midnight
Well, I'm an idiot for you
Calling sister midnight
I'm a breakage inside
Calling sister midnight
Calling sister midnight
You know, I had a dream last night
Mother was in my bed
And I made love to her
Father he gunned for me
Hunted me with his six gun
Calling sister midnight
What can I do about my dreams?
Listen to me, sister midnight
You've got me walking in rags
Listen to me, sister midnight
You put a beggar in my heart
Hey, where are you sister midnight?
Can you hear me call?
Can you hear me well?
Can you hear me at all?

Nothing remains
We could run when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
(First voice)
In your fear
Of what we have become
Take to the fire
Now we must burn
All that we are
Rise together
Through these clouds
As on wings
(2nd voice)
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love
In your fear, in your fear
As on wings
Oh
Woo
This is the trip
And this the business we take
This is our number
All my trials, Lord
Will be remembered
Everything has changed

- Lyrics and music by David Bowie
Streets turn from walls
Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy 
Steam on the floor
Shots by the mirror's frame
Clouds green and old
No Sign No nothing Now
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
All the pages that have turned
All the errors left unlearned, oh
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
In the world
Not me
Not me

We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long, long time ago
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years & years, I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died alone, a long, long time ago
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Mmm num ba dah
Dum bum ba beh
Doo buh dum ba beh beh
Pressure
Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you
No man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Mmm ba ba beh
Mmm ba ba beh
Bee de dah
Ee deh da, that's okay
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "let me out"
Pray tomorrow
Gets me higher
Pressure on people
People on streets
Deh deh dep
Mmm, mmm
Dah dah dah bah buh
Okay
(Ooh) Chipping around
Kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days
It never rains, but it pours
Ee do ah buh
Ee dah buh bah bop
Mmm do bop
Beh la
People on streets
Dee dah dee dah deh
People on streets
Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
Pressure on people
People on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence, but it don't work
Keep coming up with love, but it's so slashed and torn
Why? Why? Why?
(Love)
Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love?
'Cause love's such an old fashioned
Word and love dares you to care for
The people on the edge (People on streets) of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

Getting my facts from a Benneton ad
I'm lookin' through African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang Bang I've got you babe
Sun comes up and the man goes down
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump through hoops, we're divisable now, just disappear
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing "we shall overcome"
Whoa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come through don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes
Oh Lord, just let him see me
Lord, Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together.
Reach over race and hold each other's hands
Walk through the night thinking we are the world
Woa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come through don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I wonder why
Yes, and I wonder why sometimes
They'll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
Facist cries both black and white, who's got the blood, who's got the gun.
Putting on the black tie, cranking out the white noise
(Just a fool!)

Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I know there's something in the wind
That crazy balance of my mind
What kind of fool are you and I?
Scared to death and tell me why
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
Still I keep my love for you
You made a date with destiny
You jog-jog in my memory
You haunt in mind not fade away
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide, no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

Dear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street
There's no one there 
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see 
But my mind wants to cry out loud
I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
My mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free
Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

My love wherever you are
Whatever you are, don't lose faith
I know it's gonna happen someday
To you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
You say that the day never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
To you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
Please wait
Please wait
Please, don't lose faith
Don't lose faith
You say that the day never arrives
And it seems so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
Someday to you
To you
Please wait
Please wait
Please wait

When comes the shaking man
A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust Him at once which is something these days
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Did the world just explode?
Don't recognize anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy
In this sexual noise, vicious chords offer joy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I can't make you dance 
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
But you can't buy me off in this serial world
Who who who died and made you material girl?
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern song
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Or this shallow orb mugged by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

Burning up each others' love, burning up our lives
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight
Future full and empty knocking on my door
Ragged limbed and hungry mama 
Miracle no more
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high
Spin you round my little room, miracle goodnight
Evening flower all alone, puzzling capeche
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here
I wished I had a future, anywhere
I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin
The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal
I really don't want to know that 
The less we know, the better we feel
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high
Spinning around my little room, miracle
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Moon tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
(Eyes tell me) turn it around 
(News tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

There's no hold
The moving has come through
The danger passing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stiches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite
Glass traps open and close on night flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on night flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall
Glass traps open and close on night flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on night flights
With only one promise, only one way to call
On night flights
Only one way to fall

God is on top of it all
That's all
We are we are we are

These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life
Dreaming alone and I feel that someone
Listens to me
Angel for life
These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life
Heaven is smiling down, heaven's girl in a wedding gown
I'm gonna be so good, just like a good boy should
I'm gonna change my ways
Angel for life
Of all the saints alive
Don't I feel like a saint alive
She's not mine for eternity
Though I'll never fly so high
I'm smiling
I believe in magic
Angel for life

Where's the pain in the violent night?
I'm depressed by the grin
I stay over many years
I should have thought of that
For the love of the money
Like a black-hearted violin
It's the nature of being
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell bad from wrong
I can't pass you by
Two exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
Where the flesh meets the spirit world
Where the traffic is thin
I slip from a vacant view
I should have thought of that
And the sound of tomorrow
Like a black-hearted vile thing
Like the silence of tension
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell good from bad
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
You've been around
Can't pass you by
You've been around
But you've changed me
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change!
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
You've been around
Can't pass you by

Yeah 'n' I'm doin' all right in school
They ain't said I broke no rule
I ain't never been in Dutch
I don't browse around too much 
Don't bother me, leave me alone
Anyway I'm almost grown 
I don't run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
I'm gonna buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park 
Got my eye on a little girl
Ah, she's really out of this world
When I take her to the dance
She's got to talk about romance 
You know I'm still livin' in town
But I done married and settled down
Now I really have a ball
So I don't browse around at all

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light
In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon
And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
"Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side"
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly
In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamps
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
Well he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
And he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam

All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed, beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bomb sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
And the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
"Die" said the General
"Cobblers" said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
Till the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
But the soldier said "Sir,
There's a crack in the world"
And the figures went "squash",
And the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the sky

I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
Then she moved toward the exit, clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart, it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears, the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
Hey

The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I'll watch them sink before your gaze
Senjorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love like a ragged soldier
Catching butterflies
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh I'm so much in love like the little boy
Who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating 'round 
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
Well, all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a hoochie koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants you can give her something too
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand
Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all
You're fey, Janine
A trouper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown
So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

Fingertips sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut furs that hide behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in a tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor 
He's cloaked and clothed in saffran robes, his beads are all he owns
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man
Fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war, a gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been, I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people when they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us, you're gonna be pretty kookie, too
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching
Other people's dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay

London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Gigi, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi
Take me away
Gigi, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi
Take me today
The boys in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy,
And his sellings thorny crown
I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away,
But I loved her!
Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're far too un-kind
She loves to love all beauty,
And she says the norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
When she finds she has no money
I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now,
But I loved her!
Ah!
Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, eh

Hmm ah (giggle)
Gather round all you people
Watch me while you can
I've been trawling too long
I've been losing out strong
For the strength of another man
I've been hasty, wasty
Sitting on the backstep
Waiting for the phone to ring]
This semi-acoustic love affair
Is driving me to the brink
I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
God help all you ladies
May the devil take all you men
You're far too busy having babies
To help yourselves to a friend
You're lazy, crazy
Hung upon the insane
Standing with your back to the wall]
My pretty has a picture, oh-so nice
Hoping that you might call
I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Hey
Hey looking
I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
Oh, you don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Looking 
Just a-cruising
Vulgar
Just looking (giggle)
Don't have to be a big wheel
Don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Oh yeah (etc.)

I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes.
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess.
Because of you I need to rest,
Because it's you that sets the test.
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear,
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter.
"I gave Them life,
I gave Them all.
They drained my very soul... dry.
I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
No though for me remains there.
Nothing can They spare.
What of me?
Who prai
Sed Their efforts to be free?
Words of strength and care and sympathy.
I opened doors that would have blocked Their way.
I braved Their cause to guide, for little pay.
I ravaged at my finance just for Those,
Those whose claims were steeped in pea
Ce, tranquility.
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free.
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me."
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes.
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess.
Because of You I need to rest, oh yeah,
Because it's You that sets the test.
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me,
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word.
"We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers th
At he had.
Not of the best of men, but Ours.
We used him.
We let him use his powers.
We let him fill Our needs.
Now We are strong.
And the road is coming to its end.
Now the damned have no time to make amends.
No purse of token fortunes st
Ands in Our way.
The silent guns of love will blast the sky.
We broke the ruptured structure built of age.
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage.
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers,
Sons of d
Irt.
Infiltrated business cesspools,
Hating through Our sleeve,
Yes, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor on slogans such as
'Wish You Could Hear,'
'Love Is All We Need,'
'Kick Out The Jams,'
'Kick Out Your Mother,'
'Cut Up Y
Our Friend,'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End.'
And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above.
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe."
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain,
For I once read a book in which lovers were slain,
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain,
It said:
"I believe in the Power of Good.
I Believe in the State of Love.
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right.
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Ri
Ght to be Right."
And I open my eyes to look around,
And I see a child laid slain on the ground.
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows,
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command.
But not hearing anymore-
Not hearing anymore,
Just the shrieks from the old rich.
And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now',
And I Want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow.
And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
Live
Live
Live

Maybe I should announce it, should i
Memory of a free festival
The children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the london sky
Resting on our hands
It was god's land
It was ragged and naive
It was heaven
Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satoria must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall venusians passing through
And peter tried to climb aboard but the captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And we walked back to the road, unchained
The sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ha ha ha
(Repeat 25 times)
The sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, yeah yeah
The sun machine is coming down, woh ho ho
Sun machine is coming down, oh oh oh ah
Sun machine is coming down, oh

In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know."
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too
So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh It's the madness in his eyes
As he breaks the night to cry
It's really Me
Really You
And really Me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really You
And really Me
You'll lose me though I'm always really free
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud
And the village dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the wild eyed boy from freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand
And the Magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy, said
Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down"
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came trembling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track

Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last
It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
I'm the cream
Of the Great Utopia Dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen
I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm 
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me 
Quite amazed
As I'm unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed
I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me 
Quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your father
Quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd Browning's freak you was.
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
Mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man go
Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed
Diamond Dogs are civilised
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh! Who!
Ooh ...
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Waf waf! Woof woof! Wah wah!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool!
Diamond Dogs rule
OK?
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah. oh
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah, oh

Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car, twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon wish upon day upon day, I believe, oh, Lord
I believe all the way
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
There's my baby, lost that's all

She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright

You love bands when they're playing hard

You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

"Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All night)
But she wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture window (Doo doo doo doo)
She finds the slinky vagabond (Doo doo doo doo)
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak and his type, all for nothing (Doo doo doo doo)
Misses a step and cuts his hand, but (Doo doo doo doo)
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song, she cries
"Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yeah, ah-yeah
(She wants the young American)
All right
(All right)
Well, she wants the young American
All the way from Washington
Her breadwinner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?", well
(All night)
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yes, he does, ah
(He wants the young American)
Mmm mmm mmm
(All right) Well, all right
Well, he wants the young American
Do you remember your President Nixon? (Doo doo doo doo)
Do you remember the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American? (Doo doo doo doo)
Just you and your idol sing falsetto 'bout (Doo doo doo doo)
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor (Doo doo doo doo)
In case, just in case of depression? (Doo doo doo doo)
Sit on your hands on the bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro Sheeners
Ain't that close to love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, ain't that poster love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, it ain't that Barbie Doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and
(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American, young American)
Young American, ah
(You want the young American)
All right, ah
(All right)
You want the young American
You ain't a pimp, and you ain't a hustler
(Young American, young American)
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
(You want the young American)
(All night)
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh, boy)
I got a suite and-ah you got defeat
(All night)
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And ain't there a child I can hold without judging-ah?
(Young American, young American)
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
(All right)
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?
All night
I want the young American
(Young American, young American)
The young American
(I want the young American)
(All right)
All night, I want the young American, young American
(Young American, young American)
I want what you want, I want what you want
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want what I, I want you, you want I, I want, you want
(Young American, young American)
I want what you want, but you want what I want, you
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want I, I want you
And all I want is a young American-ah
(Young American, young American)
A young American, a young American
(I want the young American)
(All night)

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
They'll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell that you're 80, but, brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all-night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for more?)
(More)
I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all-night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)

Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet
Dead roses
Saki and strings divine
You'll make it
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war
Don't fake it
Sadden glissando strings
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell
I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?

Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from ground control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the action man:
"I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following"
The shrieking of nothing is killing just
Pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but this planet is glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing...
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again, I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said...

I'm home, lost my job and incurably ill
You think this is easy realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh no
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I got believers believing me, oh
One more weekend 
Of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers believing me
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no
Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and millions of puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers
I've got believers 
I've got believers
I've got believers in me
I've got believers
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I am a D.J.

There's a brand new dance but I don't know it's name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland, full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here
Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, turn to the right
Ooh, fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me
No, beep-beep
There's a brand new talk but it's not very clear (ooh, bop)
That people from good homes are talking this year (ooh, bop, fashion)
It's loud and it's tasteless, I've not heard it before (ooh, bop)
Shout it while you're dancing on the dance floor (ooh, bop, fashion)
Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, right
Fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me

Wake up, you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
I look out my window, what do I see?
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we work here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain, you got to make way for the Homo superior
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain, you got to make way for the Homo superior

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head
Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?

Hey my love
Goodbye love
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll, "Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound it seemed to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him, too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me, with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

Heaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way
When you're a boy
Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry
When you're a boy
When you're a boy
You can wear a uniform
When you're a boy
Other boys check you out
You get a girl
These are your favourite things
When you're a boy
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out
Uncage the colours
Unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When you're a boy
They'll never clone ya
You're always first on the line
When you're a boy
When you're a boy
You can buy a home of your own
When you're a boy
Learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes for ever and ever
What d'you say?
Du, k√∂nntest du schwimmen
Wie Delphine, Delphine es tun
Niemand gibt uns eine Chance
Doch k√∂nnen wir siegen f√ºr immer und immer
Und wir sind dann Helden f√ºr einen Tag
Ich, ich bin dann K√∂nig
Und du, du K√∂nigin
Obwohl sie unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir Helden f√ºr einen Tag
Wir sind dann wir an diesem Tag
Ich, ich glaubte zu tr√§umen (zu tr√§umen)
Die Mauer im R√ºcken war kalt (so kalt)
Sch√ºsse rei√üen die Luft (rei√üen die Luft)
Doch wir k√ºssen, als ob nichts geschieht (nichts geschieht)
Und die Scham fiel auf ihrer Seite
Oh, wir k√∂nnen sie schlagen f√ºr alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden f√ºr diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Oh oh oh oh

"You know who I am," he said.
The speaker was an angel:
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings,
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going."
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger,
Driven by the night,
Till you come."
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
See it in my eyes
Till you come."
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
Driven by the night,
Till you come"
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
Feel it in my voice,
Till you come."

The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff
From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkhuth
There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stains
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here
Well, it's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here

This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too
Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants so much to
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

Up every evening 'bout a
Half eight or nine I give my
Complete attention to a
Very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a
He's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five

She sat around forlorn
She saw my TVC one five
And baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my

So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
Oh, so demonic, oh my TVC one five

Send back my dream test baby

So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way
Be with my baby, then
We'll spend some time together

There was a time, the laughing time
I took my heart to every party
They'd point my way
"How are you today? "
"Will you make us laugh? chase our blues away? "
Their funny man won't let them down
No, he'd dance and prance and be their clown
That time, the laughing time
When even a fool learns to love
The clown turned around
And saw her smile, oh how she loved me
She'd clap her hands and beg me stay
To make her laugh, to make her life gay
Who wants the love of all the world
When here was love in the eyes of just one girl
That day, that precious day
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love
That day, that hateful day
The joke turned stale, the game was over
Those spiteful words "oh, go away. who wants to play? "
"It's getting late now."
My world, my funny world
Had lost it's mask and shown a broken heart
A time, a sour time
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love

Here comes Johnny yen again

Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand,
Jack is in his coat, and Jane is her vest, and, me,
I'm in a rock'n'roll band. Huh!
Ridin' in a Stutz-Bearcat, Jim
Y'know, those were different times!
Oh, all the poet, they studied rules of verse,
And the ladies, they rolled their eyes.
Sweet Jane! Whoa! Sweet Jane, oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!
I'll tell you something,
Jack, he is a banker,
And Jane, she is a clerk.
Both of them save their monies, ha,
And when, when they come home from work!
Ooh! Sittin' down by the fire, oh!
The radio does play,
The classical music there, Jim.
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers".
All you protest kids.
You can hear Jack say, get ready, ah,
Sweet Jane! Come on baby now! Sweet Jane! Oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!
Some people, they like to go out dancing,
And other peoples, they have to work. Just watch me now!
And there's even some evil mothers,
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt.
Y'know that, women, never really faint,
And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!
And that, y'know, children are the only ones who blush!
And that, life is, just to die!
And, everyone who ever had a heart, oh,
That wouldn't turn around and break it.
And anyone who ever played a part, whoa,
And wouldn't turn around and hate it!
Sweet Jane! Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane.
Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane.
Heavenly wine and roses,
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles. ah,
Heavenly wine and roses,
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles. hey!
La-la-la-la-la-la,
La-la-la-la-la-la,
La-la-la-la-la-la,
La-la-la-la-la-la, oh
Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane!

Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red 
Rich men's children running past 
Their fathers dressed in hose 
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes 
Gazing eyes and running wild 
Past the stocks and over stiles 
Kiss the window merry child 
But come and buy my toys 
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn 
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn 
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill 
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will 
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys 
Leave the parsley on the stalls 
Come and buy my toys 
You shall own a cambric shirt 
You shall work your father's land 
But now you shall play in the market square 
Till you'll be a man 
Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red

The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I'll watch them sink before your gaze
Senjorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love like a ragged soldier
Catching butterflies
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh I'm so much in love like the little boy
Who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

Fingertips sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut furs that hide behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in a tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor 
He's cloaked and clothed in saffran robes, his beads are all he owns
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man
Fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war, a gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been, I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder,
Because the years of threading daisies lie behind you now.
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told.
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and paints and beads.
I will show you games where the winner never wins.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key,
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals.
We shall drink the oldest wine, and velvet skies will linger.
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free.
I will hold a lighted lamp, and we shall walk together.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Your darkened eyes throw mystery,
But your lips are void of history.
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you?
I will give you dreams,
And I'll tell you things you'd like to hear.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Let me sleep beside you.

War made him a soldier 
Little Frankie Mear 
Peace left him a loser 
The little bombardier 
Lines of worry appeared with age 
Unskilled hands that knew no trade 
Spent his time in the picture house 
The little bombardier 
Frankie drank his money 
The little that he made 
Told his woes to no man 
Friendless, lonely days 
Then one day, in the ABC 
Four bright eyes gazed longingly 
At the ice-cream in the hand of 
The little bombardier 
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days 
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze 
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy 
Two young children had changed his aims 
He gave them toffees and played their games 
He brought them presents with every coin he made 
Then two gentlemen called on him 
Asked him for his name 
Why was he friends with the children 
Were they just a game? 
Leave them alone or we'll get sore 
We've had blokes like you in the station before 
The hand of authority said "no more" to 
The little bombardier 
Packed his bags, his heart in pain 
Wiped a tear and caught a train 
Not to be seen in the town again 
The little bombardier

Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door, I'll wave my flag and shout
Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid, it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool
Oh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry
Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Well, I might be able to stretch it till Wednesday

Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand
Rubber Band
In 1910, I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh
Rubber Band
Won't you play your haunting theme again to me?
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
Oh, play that theme
Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in library parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love
Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh
spoken:
Oh sob, I hope you break your baton

La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 
Jack Frost took her hand and left me
Jack Frost ain't so cool 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away 
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday 
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
See my eyes, my window pane 
See my tears like gentle rain 
That's the memory of a summer day 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
La la la la la la (repeat)

She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house.
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
And never took her out.
She wore a trench coat, khaki.
Her hobnail boots were full of holes.
She's got medals.
Her mother called her "Mary," but she changed her name to "Tommy,"
She's a one... oh.
She went and joined the army,
Passed the medical; don't ask me how it's done.
They sent her to the front line,
Fighting for her country's name.
She's got medals.
She got very tired of picking up girls,
Cleaning her gun, and shaving her curls.
Then the enemy dropped a bomb.
Survivors there were none.
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead.
She'd deserted on the previous morning.
Replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green.
Called herself Eileen.
Came to London town.
Now she's settled down.
She's got medals.

Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Potala lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly Boy Blue, blue
Silly Boy Blue
Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly Boy Blue, Blue
Silly Boy Blue
You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die
La la la la la, la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la, la la la la
La la la, la la

Child of Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song

Bow Bells strike another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away
Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you
Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys
You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys
A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, 'cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys

There is a happy land where only children live 
They don't have the time to learn the ways 
Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves 
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite 
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike 
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him 
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us 
Mother calls, but we don't hear 
There's lots more things to do 
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet 
But we will be, very shortly 
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry 
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky 
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away 
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray 
There is a happy land where only children live 
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup

Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 
Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum 
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days 
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me 
Riding on a golden horse 
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you 
Happy at the sound of your voice 
Maybe I'll slay a dragon for you 
Or banish wicked giants from the land 
But you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you 
We will only love each other as forever 
When I live my dream 
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 
And the empty man you left behind 
It's a broken heart that dreams
It's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream 
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 
Wish, and the storm will fade away 
Wish again, and you will stand before me
While the sky will paint an overture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream 
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me 
Let me be the one to understand 
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me 
Then we can live in our new land 
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream...

I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of the Swedish room
Of Hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise
Some things we could do
In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An occasional dream
And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
'Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago, long ago
And I still can't touch your name
For the days of fate were strong for you
Danced you far from me
In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream (time)
Of mine

Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red 
Rich men's children running past 
Their fathers dressed in hose 
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes 
Gazing eyes and running wild 
Past the stocks and over stiles 
Kiss the window merry child 
But come and buy my toys 
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn 
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn 
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill 
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will 
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys 
Leave the parsley on the stalls 
Come and buy my toys 
You shall own a cambric shirt 
You shall work your father's land 
But now you shall play in the market square 
Till you'll be a man 
Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red

I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you that sets the test
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
"I gave Them life, I gave Them all
They drained my very soul dry
I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts to be free?
Words of strength and care and sympathy
I opened doors that would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me"
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you that sets the test
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream
Where all is God and God is just a word
"We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood, we planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers, sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yeah, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor on slogans such as
'Wish You Could Hear'
'Love Is All We Need'
'Kick Out The Jams'
'Kick Out Your Mother'
'Cut Up Your Friend'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'
And We know the Flag of Love is from above
And We can force you to be free
And We can force you to believe"
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
"I believe in the Power of Good.
I Believe in the State of Love.
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right.
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right."
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I Want to believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to believe
There's a light shining through somehow
And I want to believe
And you want to believe
And we want to believe
And we want to live
Oh, we want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
Live
Live
Live

Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah
Don't sit down
Don't sit down
Don't sit down

I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
Then she moved toward the exit, clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart, it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears, the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
Hey

Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand
Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all
You're fey, Janine
A trouper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown
So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang
Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
'Cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang
Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang
This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang

The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do? 
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you
They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well, so do I
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay
He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake? 
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you

This girl is made of lipstick 
Powder and paint 
Sees the pictures of herself 
Every magazine on every shelf 
This girl is maid of Bond Street 
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives 
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs 
This girl is a lonely girl 
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus 
Buys the Daily News 
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her 
This girl is made of loneliness 
A broken heart 
For the boy that she once knew 
Doesn't want to know her any more 
And this girl is a lonely girl 
Every thing she wants is hers 
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with 
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy 
Jealousy 
He doesn't have a limousine 
Really wants to be a star himself 
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor 
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars 
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

The children of the summer's end gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the London sky resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven
Touch, we touched the very soul of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head and away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd and we walked back to the road, unchained
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party

There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot
And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
"Ah-choo, excuse me"
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket
"God, it's pouring down"
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, Oh God
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes my friend
And this one here's for you
"Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain"

Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand
Rubber Band
In 1910, I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh
Rubber Band
Won't you play your haunting theme again to me?
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
Oh, play that theme
Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in library parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love
Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh
spoken:
Oh sob, I hope you break your baton

La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 
Jack Frost took her hand and left me
Jack Frost ain't so cool 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away 
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday 
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
See my eyes, my window pane 
See my tears like gentle rain 
That's the memory of a summer day 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
La la la la la la (repeat)

She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house.
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
And never took her out.
She wore a trench coat, khaki.
Her hobnail boots were full of holes.
She's got medals.
Her mother called her "Mary," but she changed her name to "Tommy,"
She's a one... oh.
She went and joined the army,
Passed the medical; don't ask me how it's done.
They sent her to the front line,
Fighting for her country's name.
She's got medals.
She got very tired of picking up girls,
Cleaning her gun, and shaving her curls.
Then the enemy dropped a bomb.
Survivors there were none.
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead.
She'd deserted on the previous morning.
Replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green.
Called herself Eileen.
Came to London town.
Now she's settled down.
She's got medals.

Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Potala lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule

Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly Boy Blue, Blue
Silly Boy Blue
You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die

Reincarnation of one better man

And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear

There is a happy land where only children live 
They don't have the time to learn the ways 
Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves 
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite 
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike 
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him 
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us 
Mother calls, but we don't hear 
There's lots more things to do 
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet 
But we will be, very shortly 
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry 
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky 
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away 
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray 
There is a happy land where only children live 
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup

Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 
Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum 
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days 
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother

Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last
It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
I'm the cream
Of the Great Utopia Dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen
I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm 
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me 
Quite amazed
As I'm unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed
I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me 
Quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your father
Quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed

Here is the news:
According to the latest world population survey,
Figures have reached danger point, my god!
London: 15 million 75 thousand.
New York: 80 million.
Paris: 15 million and 30.
China: 1000 million.
Billington-Spa: lots!
My studies include exophagy.
I formed my own society,
To crush the power of fecundity.
The world will overpopulate,
Unless you claim infertility.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel 
That they are not infertible.
The crops of few, the cattle gun.
There's only one way to linger on.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
Achtung, achtung! These are your orders:
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air 
Will be slaughtered and cremated.
Only one cubic foot of air is allowed...
I've prepared a document legalising mass abortion.
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide.
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
You don't seem to hear me clear.
Do I talk above your sphere? 
Let me explain my project, dear,
Show you how I'll save the world,
Or let it die within the year.
Why do you look that way at me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
We are hungry men.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to eat you.

Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the wild eyed boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smoulders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh it's the madness in his eyes
As he breaks the night to cry:
It's really me
Really you
And really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you
And really me
You'll lose me though I'm always really free
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realise
Where the snow had saved a place
For the wild eyed boy from Freecloud
And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the wide-eyed boy from Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand
And the magic in the stare
Of the wild eyed boy said
Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face of the wise boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track

Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
They'll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell that you're 80, but, brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all-night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)

I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side

Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet
Dead roses
Saki and strings divine
You'll make it
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war
Don't fake it
Sadden glissando strings
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell
I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?

How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25

Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race

Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex

He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love

And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag
Too many snags
Well, I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed

Big brother
Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulses unreal
We'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
We'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin, we can really begin
Please saviour, save your shores
Tell me I'm rapidly yours
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to save us, someone like you
We want you, Big Brother
Big Brother!
I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone, and you've been anywhere
Lord, I'd take an overdose, if I knew what's going down
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you
Someone to lead us, someone to follow

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

I've seen all the rest of my Hollywood highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff from my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty, 'cause you just got paid
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel 
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head 
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
Please stay
You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since you pinned your baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions, a sack full of cheques
You made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
For a day
Oh yeah
Don't you care?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo!
Oh yeah

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd Browning's freak you was.
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
Mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man go
Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed
Diamond Dogs are civilised
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh! Who!
Ooh ...
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Waf waf! Woof woof! Wah wah!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool!
Diamond Dogs rule
OK?
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah. oh
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah, oh

You're like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with them now for they won't see you no more
Like a gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while, while you look for a whore
Like that sailor leaves, come back again
Stay for a while and they won't see you again
Like that gypsy caravan forever on the run
You stay for a while, then you pick up and go
That's how you show your love for me
That's how you show your love for me
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, leave a little sorrow
You're like that big, big star, he's tore the town apart
Leavin' everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, then you leave without a trace
That's exactly like that star, he tore the town apart
Leave everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, leave without a trace
That's how you show your love for me
That's how you show your love for me
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you call, you leave a little sorrow
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you stay, leave a little sorrow
Uh huh, oh
Here today, gone tomorrow
Hmm yeah
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow, yeah
Here today, here today but gone tomorrow
Thank you, we'll see you soon

I don't wanna lose, the good thing, that I've got
If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot
For your love, is better. than any love other I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock - on wood
Baby
I got superstitious, about you, but I can't take a chance
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock - on wood
Yeah!
It's no secret, but that woman, fills my lovin' cup
She seems, so ready, that I can't get enough
And her love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, it's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock - on wood
Baby!
Better, yes, better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Yes, I better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh, knock on wood
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) You know I would, would
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) It's no secret
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) No, oh, better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Above me
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) I can't leave her
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh no, baby
Knock on wood, WOO!

I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man love is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Freak out
Far out
In out

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
Uh
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe, but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just turn on with me, and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands

You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand
When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!
When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me
Oh, when you rock 'n' roll with me,
There's no one else I'd rather be, oh
Nobody down here can do it for me
When you rock 'n' roll with me
When you rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather, I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears, I'm in tears
When you rock 'n' roll with me

Hey man
Oh, leave me alone, you know
Hey man
Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man
I gotta straighten my face
This mellow-thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man
My schoolday's insane
Hey man
My work's down the drain
Hey man
Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Hey man
Oh Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man
I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man
D-droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Oh, hit me
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Oh, she's all right
My Suffragette City
My Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
Ooh, oh Suffragette City
Ooh, my Suffragette City
Ooh-how, my Suffragette City
Ooh-how, yea
Ah, wham bam thank you ma'am!
My Suffragette City
My Suffragette City - Quite alright
My Suffragette City - Too fine
My Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Suffragette!

It's safe in the city to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and...
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know."
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too
So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Time, he's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy
Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy
Time, in Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think 
Oh God I'm still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed, your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, time!

Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old-fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so
Yeah! It was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! So it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking, the manholes were smoking
Every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played a Tiger Rag
And the villains on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! And I ran to the street, looking for information
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man

Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
They'll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell that you're 80, but, brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all-night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for more?)
(More)
I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all-night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for more?)
(More)
1984

Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal
He'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
He'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin
Then we can really begin
Please saviour, saviour, show us 
Hear me, I'm graphically yours 
Someone to claim us, someone to follow 
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you
We want you, Big Brother, Big Brother
I know you think you're awful square 
But you made everyone and you've been everywhere
Lord, I'd take an overdose if you knew what's going down
Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you
Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool, someone like you
Someone to claim us, someone to follow 
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo 
Someone to fool, someone like you
We want you, Big Brother

I'll make you a deal like any other candidate.
We'll pretend were walking home cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like the street
There is a bar at the end where I could meet you and your friend.
Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
I am having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charles Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys get it here thing.
So you scream out of line
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Anytime?
Tres butch little numberwang "Hey girlie, I want you
When it's good it's really good and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar.
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying till we break up our minds
Till the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands

Brother
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Brother
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Brother
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Brother
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up

Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd Browning's freak you was.
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
Mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man go
Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed
Diamond Dogs are civilised
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh! Who!
Ooh ...
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Waf waf! Woof woof! Wah wah!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool!
Diamond Dogs rule
OK?
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah. oh
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah, oh

spoken:
And in the death,
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare,
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building
High on Poacher's Hill
And red mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City
No more big wheels.
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox -now legwarmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now
The Year of the Diamond Dogs
This ain't rock'n'roll - this is genocide.

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
Uh
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

If you want it, boys, get it here thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain?
Do you think that your face looks the same?
Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a deal, and a taste
It's got claws, it's got me, it's got you

It's safe in the city to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?

If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and...
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

Something kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way
People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today
We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by?
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard
Yet now
We feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly
They tell me "Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far"
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing it's right, knowing it's right
Now I'm hoping someone will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care
But now
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell
And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theater of financiers
Count them, fifty 'round a table
White and dressed to kill
Oh caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the dead

I've nothing much to offer
There's nothing much to take
I'm an absolute beginner
And I'm absolutely sane
As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films
There's no reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true
Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake
Oh we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches
Just like the films
If there's reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true

Oh, show me the way to the next whiskey bar
Oh, don't ask why, no don't ask why
For we must find the next whiskey bar
Oh, if we don't find the next whiskey bar
I tell you we must die

I tell you, I tell you

Oh, moon of Alabama, it's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey, oh, you know why
Oh, moon of Alabama, it's time to say goodbye

Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25
Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude 
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
Now Jimmy's looking sweet though he dresses like a queen
He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love
We can love
And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag
Too many snags
Well, I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes

Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from ground control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the action man:
"I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following"
The shrieking of nothing is killing just
Pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but this planet is glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing...
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again, I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said...

Weaving down a by-road
Singin' the song
That's my kind of high road
Gone wrong
My-my
Smile at least
You can't say no to
The Beauty and the Beast
Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong
But darling something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside here
Someone could get skinned
How?
My-my
Someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Darling
My-my
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Liebling
My-my
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should
My-my
Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank God Heaven left us
Standing on our feet
My-my
Beauty and the Beast
My-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Darling
My-my
My
My-my

Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely

You
You walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
Your scalding face
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
Too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands
Get me to a doctor's I've been told
Someone's back in town
The chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence
And my honour's at stake
The weather's grim ice on the cages
Me I'm Robin Hood and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming
If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
In the rain
Get me to the doctor
Get me off the streets (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Get me off the streets
Get some protection
Get me on my feet
While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure
To the blackout
Get me on my feet
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets (get some protection)

Baby, I've been
Breaking glass in your room again
Listen 
Don't look at the carpet
I drew something awful on it
See
You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems
I'll never touch you

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing
I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China girl?
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down
I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
And I could pretend nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says, "shh"
She says
She says
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame
(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(Get me some, fame)
(Now get-ah, fame)

Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people
And all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice cream parlour
Drinking milk shakes, cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years

(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
Don't let me hear you say life's
Taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come, get up, my baby)
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come, get up, my baby)
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car, twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon wish upon day upon day, I believe, oh, Lord
I believe all the way
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
I'll stick with you, baby, for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you
This chaos is killing me
So bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
Bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
This chaos is killing me
Hallo spaceboy, you're sleepy now

Cover you
And the chaos is killing me
Yeah, bye bye, love
So, bye bye, love

Oh, she's a tongue twisting storm
Comes to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey, not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on the 'lectric dream
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
Then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're the Spiders From Mars
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
C'mon
Come on, come on
Really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
Come on, come on

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Just for one day

Johnny's in America, no tax at the wheel

Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms, tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all
Let's sway
You could look into my eyes
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms and tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song we're playing

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

Shaky hand

Little wonder then

It's all in the tablets
Sneezy Bhutan
Little wonder then

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong

Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

Stone love, she kneels before the grave
A brave son, who gave his life to see the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love, a boy and girl are talking
New words, that only they can share in
New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in it's choosing, sweeping over 'cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving
Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love, and how my God on high is
All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him
Love is careless in it's choosing, sweeping over 'cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving

Hey my love
Goodbye love
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll, "Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound it seemed to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him, too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock 'n' roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star
Get it all, yeah
Ooh, yeah
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd come on like a regular superstar
I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star
Get it all, yeah
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd come on like a regular superstar
I could fall asleep at night as a rock 'n' roll star
I could fall in love all right as a rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star

The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff
From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkhuth
There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stains
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here
Well, it's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here

This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too
Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants so much to
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

Up every evening 'bout a
Half eight or nine I give my
Complete attention to a
Very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a
He's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
I brought my baby home, she
She sat around forlorn
She saw my TVC one five
And baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my
She crawled right in my
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
Oh, so demonic, oh my TVC one five
Maybe if I pray every
Each night I sit there pleading
Send back my dream test baby
She's my main feature
My TVC one five, he
He just stares back unblinking
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way
Be with my baby, then
We'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
My baby's in there someplace

Mmm num ba dah
Dum bum ba beh
Doo buh dum ba beh beh
Pressure
Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you
No man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Mmm ba ba beh
Mmm ba ba beh
Bee de dah
Ee deh da, that's okay
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "let me out"
Pray tomorrow
Gets me higher
Pressure on people
People on streets
Deh deh dep
Mmm, mmm
Dah dah dah bah buh
Okay
(Ooh) Chipping around
Kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days
It never rains, but it pours
Ee do ah buh
Ee dah buh bah bop
Mmm do bop

People on streets
Dee dah dee dah deh
People on streets
Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
Pressure on people
People on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence, but it don't work
Keep coming up with love, but it's so slashed and torn
Why? Why? Why?
(Love)
Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love?
'Cause love's such an old fashioned
Word and love dares you to care for
The people on the edge (People on streets) of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure

You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes
So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do
What in the world can you do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
Oh
I'm just a little bit afraid of you
Cause love won't make you cry
But, wait until the crowd goes
Oh, Wait until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you
So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do
What in the world can I do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
Oh, what you gonna say?
Oh, what you gonna do?
Ah, what you gonna be?
To be real me, to the real me
Under the cool, under the cool and under having a ball
What you gonna say to the real me, to the real me
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me, with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

And I say to myself
I've got it wrong, wrong, wrong
She is a play-girl
She the wrong wrong girl for me
And I say to myself
You're a fool, fool, fool
She doesn't love you
She doesn't need you, this I know
She's got a trail of men that she takes
Wherever she goes
She hasn't the strength to love any single man for a length of time
(And I say to myself)
Ooh, I don't stand a chance
(And I say to myself)
It's a long long romance
(And I say to myself)
Well, she's out to slay
(And I say to myself)
Well, she's got it made
(And I say to myself)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
(And I say to myself)
Oh yeah
And I say to myself that she shouldn't love anybody else in the world but me
And I say to myself
Forget her now, now, now
She don't want you
She don't love you anymore
And I say to myself you're a fool, fool, fool
She's don't love you
She don't need you, this I know
And I turn around and look at myself
You'll never get her, you're a fool
Say after me I'm a fool- I'm a fool
(And I say to myself)
I can't get what I want
(And I say to myself)
And it makes me sad

I can't get what I want

Ooh, I gotta take her
(Baby loves that way)
Yep, I love her
Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy
(Baby loves that way)
Oh, I love my baby
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh, she does too much to me
(Baby loves that way)
And I can't think too much of her
(Baby loves that way)
Gotta take her, gotta take her
Gonna better leave her alone, put you down son
Treating her real fine, thus I'm home being a loner
Jeanny's my babe and that's alright, yeah
She treats me good, each and every night
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy
(Baby loves that way)

Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She clings around with all the boys, who treat her like unwanted toys
(Baby loves that way)
Obviously this is the end
(Baby loves that way)
Gotta take her
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh yeah
(Baby loves that way)
Can't do enough
(Baby loves that way

La la la la la la la la (etc.)
Gather you all and listen here
I'll tell you a tale if you lend me an ear
I rode a horse through many a town
But the devil rode me down to the ground
I was to marry a very rich girl
I loved her as only I can
But the father was shot and his gold was stoled
And now I'm the devil's man, na na na
And now I sing a tale of woe
Through the bars of the county jail, na la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la (etc.)
I walked into the room one night
I found her mother and gun
Well, the man was dead and I kneeled and cried
The sheriff ran in and said "I'm holding you, son"
La la la la la la la la (etc.)
Through the day I sing and play
For time is on my side
But when the moon and stars come out
I lay me down and cry
For the Saviour, mar I lied
Now I will not have a ride
Beside the window the scaffold was made
On the morrow I will hang...
La la la la la la la la (etc.)

Question time
That says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
Mother says
That she can't stand the neighbours' talking
I've gotta pack my bags
Leave this home, start walking, yeah
I'm guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Remember when
We used to go to church on Sundays
I lay awake at night
Terrified of school on Mondays
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends always be found
And I can't
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Now I leave them all
In the Never-Never Land
The station seems so cold
The ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name,
"Hi Dave.
Drop in, see you around, come back
If you're this way again."
Oh, I'm on my own
I've got a long, long way to go
I hope I make it on my own
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

Two by two, they go walking by
Hand in hand, they watch me cry

Lonely nights, I dream you're there
Morning sun and you're gone

Well, I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
To be loved by me
All the world couldn't take your place
Another girl, another face
Wouldn't be the type of thing
Know I've found it out and see
Another girl standing next to me
Oh no, just you
Oh no, just you
Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, I see your name

Everywhere I go, it's just the same

I've got the village I love
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't know a thing
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig
I feed the lions in Trafalgar Square and I dig everything
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug
Everything
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig
I've got more friends than I've had hot dinners
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything
Dig
I've made myself at home
I've made good friends which the time-check girl on the end of the phone
All the movie shows
I sunbathe for love
Even when it's not too hot
'Cause I dig everything
Oh yeah

You can go where you may
But I'll follow you
Wherever you go
Just turn around and you know

'Cause I'll follow you
Wherever you go
Just turn around and you know

See you strong in the failing light
Just as strong, late at night
You can't lose my trail on you
Just you try, just you try
See me now, lost me now

Just turn around and you know
I'll be waiting there
Duh-dum-duh-dum

Yes, I've read the morning papers
Telling me that you've made money
Do you think I'm gonna crawl, then think again
Though I'm dressed in rags, I'm richer
Though I eat from tins, I'm healthier
Though I live in slums, I'm purer than you, my friend
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend
Look around and see the friends
The ones you left, our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you
Don't look down your nose at me
'Cause I won't ask your sympathy
I won't be your yes-sir man for anything
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend
I would walk with you
Talk with you, drink with you
If you drop that halo that you're wearing on the ground
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend
I can't get my satisfaction
Knowing you won't get reaction
What makes me the big attraction anyway
It's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep

Back to my baby
Back to where they need me

You think you're gonna please her
So you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her
'Cause you're playing with the spider who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my-oh-my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes
Or she'll throw you right off her hook
Here's the news- you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Take my tip- get on out
Take my tip- get on out
You can't give all you got to take something back
Before she'll put you right up on her rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip- get on out
Take my tip- get on out
You think you're gonna please her
So you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her
'Cause you're playing with the tiger who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my-oh-my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes
Or she'll throw you right off her hook
Here's the news- you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Get it off, take my tip
Get it off, take my tip
You can't give all you have to take something back
Before she'll put you right up on the rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip- get on out
Take my tip- get on out
Take my tip- get on out
Take my tip- get on out

I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way
Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
I thought my day would come
When I would be
The only one
I thought my day would come
Under the moon
And under the sun
Now I shout through all the streets today
Lucky me, your love has come my way
Now tell me I was a fool
Up where the moon is shining so brightly
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
I believe that dreams come through
I believe, because of you
He who made the stars in the sky
Made the world for you and I
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way
Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

You've got a habit of leaving me
And you've got a habit of deserting me
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I'm so sad
Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad
You could go on if you wanted to, wanted to, wanted to
Wanted to
Oh
If you wanted to, yeah
Oh huh
You've got a habit of leaving me
And you've got a habit of deserting me
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I'm so sad
Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad
You could go on if you wanted to, wanted, wanted to
Wanted to, ooh yeah, yeah
Oh, if you wanted to
If you wanted to, yeah, yeah

My, my, the time do fly
When it's in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For I've never been a winner in my life
I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh, it's the animal in me
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand
And I'll walk you through the doors
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
My, my, but time do fly
When it's in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For I've never been a sinner, la di da
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back 
In Atlantic City
There's not even a demon 
In Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise 
As I walk down the aisle?
And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone 
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Two young men 
Dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad-tempered child 
On a rain slicked street
And I'm gone gone gone
And I'm older than movies
Oh, let me dance, babe
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone
Through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man

Are you OK?
You've been shot in the head
And I'm holding your brains
The old woman said
So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky
See nothing at all
The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the yoga zone
Turn to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
It's nothing at all
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you

Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes

Nothing ever goes away

Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress

See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You come to me with tears and blame

Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it, when he came to us
That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale
So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below
When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress
Only sky, a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness
And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield
To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed
Baal survived it, he just used his eyes
And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room
"Space enough" said Baal, "then I'll thicken the ground
Space enough within this woman's womb"
Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
It's the man who practices it, he can't abide
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much
Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you
Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep
Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup
When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
He'll just have enough sky when he's dead
Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with us

It was a day in that blue month September
Silent beneath the plum trees' slender shade
I held her there
My love, so pale and silent
As if she were a dream that must not fade
Above us in the shining summer heaven
There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon
It was quite white and very high above us
Then I looked up
And found that it had gone
And since that day, so many moons in silence
Have swum across the sky and gone below
The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood
And if you ask, how does that love seem now
I must admit, I really can't remember
And yet I know what you are trying to say
But what her face was like, I know no longer
I only know I kissed it on that day
As for the kiss, I long ago forgot it
But for the cloud that floated in the sky
I know that still and shall forever know it
It was quite white and moved in very high
It may be that the plum trees still are blooming
That woman's seventh child may now be there
And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes
When I looked up
It vanished on the air

Sickened by sun, with rainstorms lashing him rotten
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten
Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there
Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades
You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed
Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans
Though his mother has given him up for lost
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition
Always in search of that land where life seems best
Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises
Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises
With a blue sky overhead and nothing else

If a woman's hips are ample
Then I want her in the hay
Skirt and stocking all a rample
Cheerfully
For that's my way
If the woman bites in pleasure
Then I wipe it clean with hay
My mouth, her lap together
Thoroughly
For that's my way
If the woman goes on loving
When I feel too tired to play
I'd smile and go off waving
Amiably
For that's my way

Once she had drowned and started her slow descent
Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh, the open sky shone most magnificent 
As if it was acting as her body's guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip
And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts
First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpse-choked rivers just one more corpse

Wow, this ain't the right thing to do
So, so let, so let's go
Young girls they know what they're after
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang reach for the sky
I keep a good friend on videotape
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight
Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang sun don't shine
Bang Bang you all angels
Bang Bang now you all ought to be in pictures
Oh girl
Oh girl my problems can't follow me
Phone calls I take my machine
I wander lonely to the sea
Lonely-Ha Ha Ha-what does it mean
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang and you are next in line
Bang Bang reach for the sky
Bang Bang sun don't shine
Rise buildings
Rise to the sky
Well young girls they know what they're after
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Bang bang
Then you close, then you should close, then you close down 
You big man
Bang Bang
Spot the brack
Just come in first
Bang Bang
If praise had wings
Bang Bang
And you next in line

Blue Jean, I just met a girl named Blue Jean
Blue Jean, she got a camouflaged face and no money
Remember, they always let you down when you need 'em
Oh, Blue Jean, is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean?
She got a police bike
She got a turned up nose
Sometimes I feel like (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me (Oh, somebody send me)
One day, I'm gonna write a poem in a letter
One day, I'm gonna get that faculty together
Remember that everybody has to wait in line
For Blue Jean, look out world, you know I've got mine
She got Latin roots
She got everything
Sometimes I feel like (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Sometimes I feel like (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody somebody (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me (Oh, somebody send me)

Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing
I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China girl?
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down
I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
And I could pretend nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says, "shh"
She says
She says
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh

Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Day-in, ooh ooh
Day-out, ooh ooh ooh
She was born in a handbag, love left on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup, nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey, try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Day-in, ooh ooh
Day-out, ooh ooh ooh
First thing she learns is she's a citizen,
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Someone rings a bell and it's all over
She's going out her way
Stealing for that one good rush
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
She could use a little money
She's hangin' on his arms like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey, she's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night, big town, police, shake down
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
She's got a ticket to nowhere
She's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name
She's in the pocket of a home boy
Ooh she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow
Spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make them well aware
She's an angry gal
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Suddenly there's angels everywhere
Angels in a ton of sound
And they shootin' her down
Shootin' her with video-drugs-bullets and promises

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame
(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(Get me some, fame)
(Now get-ah, fame)

There's a brand new dance but I don't know it's name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland, full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here
Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, turn to the right
Ooh, fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me
No, beep-beep
There's a brand new talk but it's not very clear (ooh, bop)
That people from good homes are talking this year (ooh, bop, fashion)
It's loud and it's tasteless, I've not heard it before (ooh, bop)
Shout it while you're dancing on the dance floor (ooh, bop, fashion)
Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, right
Fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me
No, beep-beep... beep-beep

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Just for one day

So messed up I want you here
And in my room I want you here
And now we're gonna be face to face
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place
Yeah you know what that is
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
(C'mon) (I want to be your dog you know it)
Ooh give it to me
Now I'm ready to close my eyes
Yes now I'm ready to close my mind
Now I'm ready to feel your hands
Lose my heart on the burning sand
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
(C'mon) (I want to be your dog you know it)
Do it
Yeah that's right
So messed up I want you here
And in my room I want you here
And now we're gonna be face to face
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place
Yeah you know what that is
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
(C'mon) (I want to be your dog you know it)
Well come on
I'll be your dog.

Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms, tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all
Let's sway
You could look into my eyes
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms and tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song we're playing
Let's sway
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight
Let's dance
Let's
Let's
Let's
Let's sway
Let's
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's sway
Let's sway
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance

Watching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're traveling the holy land
Opening telegrams oh ho
Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind oh ho
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan
Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays oh ho
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail oh ho
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear oh ho
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
You pray till the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you'll believe you're loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
Believeing the strangest things (loving the alien)

I know when to go out
I know when to stay in
Get things done
I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try, I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try, I try
Never gonna fall for
(Modern love) Walks beside me
(Modern love) Walks on by
(Modern love) Gets me to the church on time 
(Church on time) Terrifies me
(Church on time) Makes me party
(Church on time) Puts my trust in God and man
(God and man) No confessions
(God and man) No religion
(God and man) I don't believe in modern love
It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try, I try
Never gonna fall for
(Modern love) Walks beside me
(Modern love) Walks on by
(Modern love) Gets me to the church on time 
(Church on time) Terrifies me
(Church on time) Makes me party
(Church on time) Puts my trust in God and man
(God and man) No confessions
(God and man) No religion
