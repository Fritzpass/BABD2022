Oh pity us here we angels of lead
We're dead, we're sick hanging by thread
Get real
Get real
You can't stop meaningful teenage cries
From deep behind fifty year old eyes
Get real
Get real
I'm scared to touch
Too tense to be undone
I walk the streets
Not expecting morning sun
Against the voice of doom
Failures fall all over town
I guess I should, I feel I should
Get real
Get real
What's up?
What happened when I wasn't around?
Who did what?
What went down?
Get real
Get real
Think about myself it happens to me
It happens in the tunnel when I let myself feel
Get real
Get real
I feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town
I feel I should, I guess I should
Get real
Get real
Get real
Get real
The dazzle of light
The rape of life
The seed, the curse
The jazz of life
Get real
Get real
Get real
Get real

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you
This chaos is killing me
So bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
Bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
This chaos is killing me
Hallo spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you
And the chaos is killing me
Yeah, bye bye, love
So, bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
So, bye bye, love
This chaos is killing me
This chaos is killing me
Yeah, bye bye, love
Bye bye, love
Good time, love
Be sweet, sweet dove
Bye bye, spaceboy
Bye bye, love
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you

Baby Grace is the victim
She was 14 years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning
For the finger points at me
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
No, I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies
And the prison priests are decent
My attorney seems sincere
I fear my days are numbered
Lord, get me out of here
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies
This is your shadow on my wall
This is my flesh and blood
This is what I could've been
And the wheels are turning and turning
As the twentieth century dies
If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If I'd only paid my bill
(All's well)
I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies
This is my bunk with two sheets
This is my food though foul
This is what I could have been
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies
All's well
Twentieth century dies
All's well
All's well
All's well
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
All's well
Twentieth century dies

Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond
Cruise me, babe
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond
No return
No return
I'm deranged
I'm deranged down down down
I'm deranged down down down
So cruise me babe, cruise me babe beyond
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me, baby
The clutch of life and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me, babe
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in

Stay away from the future
Back away from the light
It's all deranged
No control
Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkened shore would not bother me
If I can't control the web we weave
My life will be lost in fallen leaves
Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
I shall live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've gotta have a scheme, you've gotta have a plan
In the world of today for tomorrow's man
No control
Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
Forbidden words deafen me
In memory, no control
See how far a sinful man
Burned his tracks, his bloody robes
You've gotta have a scheme, you gotta have a plan
In the world of today for tomorrow's man
I shall live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
No control
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
Deranged
Deranged

Now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow
It happens today
The damage today
They fall on today
They beat on the outside
And I'll stand by you
Now
Not tomorrow
It's happening now
Not tomorrow
It's happening now
The crazed in the hot-zone
The mental and diva's hands
The feasting of life
To the music outside
To the music outside
It happens outside
The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
It's happening, now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow
The music is outside
It's happening outside

My name is Mr. Touchshriek 
Of Touchshriek mail order and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and empty females
I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop 
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide intellect
He's a broken man
I'm also a broken man
It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric
Some of the houses around here still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing
If I had another broken man
Oh, I dream of something like that

Test, testing, testing
This, and, Grace is my name 
And, and I was, umm
It was that phot... a fading photograph of 
A patch, patchwork quilt
And they've put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs 
So I'm thinking very, too, bit too fast like a brain patch
And ah they won't let me see anybody
If, if I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop, popular musics 
And aftershocks 
I've been watching a television of, ah, in the homelands
That's the new homelands 
And um, and that's all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horrid

Ramona is so cold
When she broke it off with Leon, she said
"The ring is enough,
I don't wanna see this face again."
Ramona was so cold
Ramona was so cold

Old Touchschriek was the main nameserver
Suspected of being a shoulder surfer
But he didn't know from shit
About challenge response systems
Now Ramona A. Stone, we knew was selling interest drugs
She got males all hung up on her mind filters
She was if you don't mind me saying so an update demon
Now Leon
He couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight
He jumps up on the stage with a criss criss machete
And slashes around cutting a zero on everything
I mean a zero in the fabric of time itself
Was this a suspect?
I says to myself
"Woah! Quelle courage!"
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself
Let me take you back to when it all began

I was Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste in a tunnel
But I've been having a mid-life crisis
And I've been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny coloured English
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name, I am with name
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
She should say: twitch & stream
It'll end in chrome
Night of the female good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
She should say:
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millennium fetish
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
I am with name
Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
I am Ramona A. Stone
Give it to me one more time
Anxiety descending
Anxiety descending

You, you, you
You, you, you
All our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun
No peachy prayers
No trendy rechauff√©
I'm with you
So I can't go on
All my violence
Raining tears upon the sheet
I'm bewildered
For we're strangers when we meet
Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you
Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes
All my violence
Raining tears upon the sheet
I'm resentful
For we're strangers when we meet
Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new
Your embrace
Was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu
Steely resolve
Is falling from me
My poor soul
All bruised passivity
All your regrets
Ride rough-shod over me
I'm so glad
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover
For we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over
But we're strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet

For we're living in a safety zone
Don't be holding back from me
We're living from hour to hour down here
And we'll take it when we can
It's a kind of living which recognizes
The death of the odorless man
When nothing is vanity, nothing's too slow
It's not Eden but it's no sham
There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And it's lights up, boys
Lights up, boys
Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While we're swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man
And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And the silence flies on its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives
And there's no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you
I don't know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding you

Turn, and turn again
Turn, and turn again
I shake and stare the sun
Till my eyes burn
I shake at the mothers
Brutal vermin
I shake and stare
At the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober philistine
Turn, and turn again
Worm, the pain and blade
Turn, and turn again
The screw
Is a tightening atrocity
I shake
For the reeking flesh is as romantic as hell
The need
To have seen it all
The voyeur
Of utter destruction as beauty
I shake
Turn, and turn again
I shake
Turn, and turn again
I shake
I shake
I shake

Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson
His delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds
It's difficult you see
To give up, baby
To leave a job
When you know the money's from day to day
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes
Cold winter bleeds on the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand
Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson
His delay just wasting my time
It's difficult, you see
To give up, baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes
It's difficult, you see
It's difficult, you see
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes

White boys falling on the fires of night
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
I'd rather be inside you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you
You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
Mama can I kiss you? daddy can I kiss? (no)
(I wish you well) Innocence passed me by
Wanna be screwing when the nightmare comes
(I wish you well, I wish you well)
Wanna come quick and die
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you
You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
(Shoes, shoes, little white shoes)
Where have all the flowers gone?
All the little fragile champion boys
(Toys, toys, little black toys)
Dripping on the end of a gun
Even if you disagree
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you, we prick you, we prick you
You show respect, even if you disagree

You show respect, even if you disagree
You show respect
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
(Even if you disagree, even if you disagree)
Toys, toys, little black toys
Wish you well, wish you well
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you well

Cruising around me, the flames burn my body
Wishful beginnings
Does this remind them again and again
You're a sorry little girl
You're a sorry little girl
Please hide
For the pain must feel like snow
You're a sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
Please hide
From the kiss and the bite
Shame burns
Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in, only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
I'm no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
I'm sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
Cover me, cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down
We had such wishful beginnings
But we lived unbearable lives
I'm sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
So so sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
There you go

Friends say it's fine 
Friends say it's good 
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood 
I walk like a rat
Crawl like a cat
Sting like a bee 
Babe I'm gonna be your man
And it's plain to see 
You were meant for me 
Yeah, I'm your toy 
Your 20th Century boy 
Friends say it's fine 
Friends say it's good 
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood

I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known
A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.

Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25
Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude 
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
Now Jimmy's looking sweet though he dresses like a queen
He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love
We can love
And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag
Too many snags
Well, I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude
All the young dudes

Every chance
Every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
I was always looking
Left and right
Always crashing in the same car
Jasmine, I saw you peeping
As I put my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to ninety-four
But I'm always crashing in the same car

He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back 
In Atlantic City
There's not even a demon 
In Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise 
As I walk down the aisle?
And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone 
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Two young men 
Dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad-tempered child 
On a rain slicked street
And I'm gone gone gone
And I'm older than movies
Oh, let me dance, babe
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone
Through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame
(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(Get me some, fame)
(Now get-ah, fame)

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Just for one day

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear my crown of shit
On my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stain of time
The feeling disappears
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

I can't read and I can't write down
I don't know a book from countdown
I don't care which shadow gets me
All I've got is someone's face
Money goes to money heaven
Bodies go to body hell
I just cough, catch the chase
Switch the channel watch the police car
I can't read shit anymore
I just sit back and ignore
'Cause I just can't get it right, can't get it right
I can't read shit I can't read shit
Oh
When you see a famous smile
No matter where you run your mile
To be right in that photograph
Andy where's my fifteen minutes
I said
Yeah
I can't read shit anymore
I just can't read shit anymore
No matter I just can't get it right
I can't reach it
I can't reach it
No
No
Uh
Uh
Uh

She had an horror of rooms she was tired you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again
She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies
She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet
Dead roses
Saki and strings divine
You'll make it
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war
Don't fake it
Sadden glissando strings
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell
I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
(See the lights all shining bright on Broadway)

I've seen all the rest of my Hollywood highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff from my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty, 'cause you just got paid
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel 
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head 
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
Please stay
You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since you pinned your baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions, a sack full of cheques
You made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
For a day
Oh yeah
Don't you care?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo!
Oh yeah

Let me put my arms around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh, babe, it'll be all right
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fallout saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
That stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Where once had raged a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday, yeah
Yeah
Drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
Drive, drive-in Saturday (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a drive-in Saturday, yeah (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
(It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)

She'll come, she'll go.
She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul
Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta
And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast.
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She'll come, she'll go.
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become
Her point of view
And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast.
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end (repeat)

Ooh
He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions, they followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Putting on some clothes, I made my way to school
I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights
Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table, a gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit, he'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust," I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Ow

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace, child
I moved up to take a place
Near you
So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart
In pieces
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day, though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
Prettiest star
One day, though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star

Time, he's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy
Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy
Time, in Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think 
Oh God I'm still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed, your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, time!

Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old-fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so
Yeah! It was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! So it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking, the manholes were smoking
Every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played a Tiger Rag
And the villains on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! And I ran to the street, looking for information
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man

I wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me
But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown
And I'm still so afraid
Yes, I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid on my own
On my own
What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds
If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile
Then I won't feel afraid
No, I won't feel afraid
I won't be, be afraid
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25
Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude 
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
Now Jimmy's looking sweet though he dresses like a queen
He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love
We can love
And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag
Too many snags
Well, I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes

My, my, the time do fly
When it's in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For I've never been a winner in my life
I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh, it's the animal in me
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand
And I'll walk you through the doors
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
My, my, but time do fly
When it's in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For I've never been a sinner, la di da
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?
I miss your kissin' and I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
Just run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet and send it to me
I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you di yi yi yi yine
D -A -V -I -D
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
So bloody your hands on the cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame
(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(Get me some, fame)
(Now get-ah, fame)

In the event that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion and we never get old
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable, too.
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
It's a very modern world, but nobody is perfect
It's a moving world, but that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we?
And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember it's true, a loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable, too.
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
But any sudden movement, and I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you
This chaos is killing me
So bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
Bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
This chaos is killing me
Hallo spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you
And the chaos is killing me
Yeah, bye bye, love
So, bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
So, bye bye, love
This chaos is killing me
This chaos is killing me
Yeah, bye bye, love
Bye bye, love
Good time, love
Be sweet, sweet dove
Bye bye, spaceboy
Bye bye, love
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you
Moondust will cover you

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

See the great white scar
Over Battery park
Then a flare glides over
But I won't look at that scar
Oh, my nuclear baby
Oh, my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
Let's face the music and dance
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) A new killer star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) The stars in your eyes
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in color
First a horseback bomber
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on dateline
Let's face the music and dance
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) A new killer star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) The stars in your eyes
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)

- Lyrics and music by David Bowie 
Tragic youth was looking young and sexy
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief
The tragic youth was going down on me
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
I built a wall of sound to separate us
And hid among the junk of wretched highs
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Ha ha ha ha
Whoo hoo
Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight
Da da da da da da da da da
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da da da da da da da da da
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
Woo hoo
I still don't remember how this happened
I still don't get the wherefores and the whys
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
Hey boy welcome to reality
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
I've been right and I've been wrong
Now I'm back where I started from
Never looked over reality's shoulder
Ha ha ha ha
Huh ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Huh ha ha
Wooh
Woo hoo
Wooh

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
Uh
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

Calling sister midnight
You've got me reaching for the moon
Calling sister midnight
You've got me playing the fool
Calling sister midnight
Calling sister midnight
Can you hear me call?
Can you hear me well?
Can you hear me at all?
Calling sister midnight
Well, I'm an idiot for you
Calling sister midnight
I'm a breakage inside
Calling sister midnight
Calling sister midnight
You know, I had a dream last night
Mother was in my bed
And I made love to her
Father he gunned for me
Hunted me with his six gun
Calling sister midnight
What can I do about my dreams?
Listen to me, sister midnight
You've got me walking in rags
Listen to me, sister midnight
You put a beggar in my heart
Hey, where are you sister midnight?
Can you hear me call?
Can you hear me well?
Can you hear me at all?

Nothing remains
We could run when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
(First voice)
In your fear
Of what we have become
Take to the fire
Now we must burn
All that we are
Rise together
Through these clouds
As on wings
(2nd voice)
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love
In your fear, in your fear
As on wings
Oh
Woo
This is the trip
And this the business we take
This is our number
All my trials, Lord
Will be remembered
Everything has changed

- Lyrics and music by David Bowie
Streets turn from walls
Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy 
Steam on the floor
Shots by the mirror's frame
Clouds green and old
No Sign No nothing Now
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
All the pages that have turned
All the errors left unlearned, oh
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
In the world
Not me
Not me

We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long, long time ago
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years & years, I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died alone, a long, long time ago
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Mmm num ba dah
Dum bum ba beh
Doo buh dum ba beh beh
Pressure
Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you
No man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Mmm ba ba beh
Mmm ba ba beh
Bee de dah
Ee deh da, that's okay
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "let me out"
Pray tomorrow
Gets me higher
Pressure on people
People on streets
Deh deh dep
Mmm, mmm
Dah dah dah bah buh
Okay
(Ooh) Chipping around
Kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days
It never rains, but it pours
Ee do ah buh
Ee dah buh bah bop
Mmm do bop
Beh la
People on streets
Dee dah dee dah deh
People on streets
Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
Pressure on people
People on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence, but it don't work
Keep coming up with love, but it's so slashed and torn
Why? Why? Why?
(Love)
Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love?
'Cause love's such an old fashioned
Word and love dares you to care for
The people on the edge (People on streets) of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

Getting my facts from a Benneton ad
I'm lookin' through African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang Bang I've got you babe
Sun comes up and the man goes down
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump through hoops, we're divisable now, just disappear
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing "we shall overcome"
Whoa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come through don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes
Oh Lord, just let him see me
Lord, Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together.
Reach over race and hold each other's hands
Walk through the night thinking we are the world
Woa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come through don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I wonder why
Yes, and I wonder why sometimes
They'll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
Facist cries both black and white, who's got the blood, who's got the gun.
Putting on the black tie, cranking out the white noise
(Just a fool!)

Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I know there's something in the wind
That crazy balance of my mind
What kind of fool are you and I?
Scared to death and tell me why
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
Still I keep my love for you
You made a date with destiny
You jog-jog in my memory
You haunt in mind not fade away
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide, no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

Dear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street
There's no one there 
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see 
But my mind wants to cry out loud
I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
My mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free
Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

My love wherever you are
Whatever you are, don't lose faith
I know it's gonna happen someday
To you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
You say that the day never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
To you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
Please wait
Please wait
Please, don't lose faith
Don't lose faith
You say that the day never arrives
And it seems so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
Someday to you
To you
Please wait
Please wait
Please wait

When comes the shaking man
A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust Him at once which is something these days
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Did the world just explode?
Don't recognize anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy
In this sexual noise, vicious chords offer joy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I can't make you dance 
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
But you can't buy me off in this serial world
Who who who died and made you material girl?
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern song
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Or this shallow orb mugged by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

Burning up each others' love, burning up our lives
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight
Future full and empty knocking on my door
Ragged limbed and hungry mama 
Miracle no more
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high
Spin you round my little room, miracle goodnight
Evening flower all alone, puzzling capeche
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here
I wished I had a future, anywhere
I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin
The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal
I really don't want to know that 
The less we know, the better we feel
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high
Spinning around my little room, miracle
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Moon tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
(Eyes tell me) turn it around 
(News tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

There's no hold
The moving has come through
The danger passing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stiches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite
Glass traps open and close on night flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on night flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall
Glass traps open and close on night flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on night flights
With only one promise, only one way to call
On night flights
Only one way to fall

God is on top of it all
That's all
We are we are we are

These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life
Dreaming alone and I feel that someone
Listens to me
Angel for life
These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life
Heaven is smiling down, heaven's girl in a wedding gown
I'm gonna be so good, just like a good boy should
I'm gonna change my ways
Angel for life
Of all the saints alive
Don't I feel like a saint alive
She's not mine for eternity
Though I'll never fly so high
I'm smiling
I believe in magic
Angel for life

Where's the pain in the violent night?
I'm depressed by the grin
I stay over many years
I should have thought of that
For the love of the money
Like a black-hearted violin
It's the nature of being
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell bad from wrong
I can't pass you by
Two exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
Where the flesh meets the spirit world
Where the traffic is thin
I slip from a vacant view
I should have thought of that
And the sound of tomorrow
Like a black-hearted vile thing
Like the silence of tension
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell good from bad
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
You've been around
Can't pass you by
You've been around
But you've changed me
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change!
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
You've been around
Can't pass you by

Yeah 'n' I'm doin' all right in school
They ain't said I broke no rule
I ain't never been in Dutch
I don't browse around too much 
Don't bother me, leave me alone
Anyway I'm almost grown 
I don't run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
I'm gonna buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park 
Got my eye on a little girl
Ah, she's really out of this world
When I take her to the dance
She's got to talk about romance 
You know I'm still livin' in town
But I done married and settled down
Now I really have a ball
So I don't browse around at all

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light
In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon
And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
"Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side"
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly
In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamps
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
Well he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
And he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam

All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed, beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bomb sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
And the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
"Die" said the General
"Cobblers" said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
Till the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
But the soldier said "Sir,
There's a crack in the world"
And the figures went "squash",
And the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the sky

I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
Then she moved toward the exit, clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart, it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears, the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
Hey

The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I'll watch them sink before your gaze
Senjorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love like a ragged soldier
Catching butterflies
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh I'm so much in love like the little boy
Who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating 'round 
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
Well, all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a hoochie koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants you can give her something too
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand
Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all
You're fey, Janine
A trouper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown
So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

Fingertips sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut furs that hide behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in a tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor 
He's cloaked and clothed in saffran robes, his beads are all he owns
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man
Fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war, a gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been, I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people when they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us, you're gonna be pretty kookie, too
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching
Other people's dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay

London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Gigi, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi
Take me away
Gigi, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi
Take me today
The boys in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy,
And his sellings thorny crown
I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away,
But I loved her!
Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're far too un-kind
She loves to love all beauty,
And she says the norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
When she finds she has no money
I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now,
But I loved her!
Ah!
Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, eh

Hmm ah (giggle)
Gather round all you people
Watch me while you can
I've been trawling too long
I've been losing out strong
For the strength of another man
I've been hasty, wasty
Sitting on the backstep
Waiting for the phone to ring]
This semi-acoustic love affair
Is driving me to the brink
I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
God help all you ladies
May the devil take all you men
You're far too busy having babies
To help yourselves to a friend
You're lazy, crazy
Hung upon the insane
Standing with your back to the wall]
My pretty has a picture, oh-so nice
Hoping that you might call
I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Hey
Hey looking
I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
Oh, you don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Looking 
Just a-cruising
Vulgar
Just looking (giggle)
Don't have to be a big wheel
Don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Oh yeah (etc.)

I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes.
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess.
Because of you I need to rest,
Because it's you that sets the test.
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear,
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter.
"I gave Them life,
I gave Them all.
They drained my very soul... dry.
I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
No though for me remains there.
Nothing can They spare.
What of me?
Who prai
Sed Their efforts to be free?
Words of strength and care and sympathy.
I opened doors that would have blocked Their way.
I braved Their cause to guide, for little pay.
I ravaged at my finance just for Those,
Those whose claims were steeped in pea
Ce, tranquility.
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free.
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me."
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes.
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess.
Because of You I need to rest, oh yeah,
Because it's You that sets the test.
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me,
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word.
"We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers th
At he had.
Not of the best of men, but Ours.
We used him.
We let him use his powers.
We let him fill Our needs.
Now We are strong.
And the road is coming to its end.
Now the damned have no time to make amends.
No purse of token fortunes st
Ands in Our way.
The silent guns of love will blast the sky.
We broke the ruptured structure built of age.
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage.
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers,
Sons of d
Irt.
Infiltrated business cesspools,
Hating through Our sleeve,
Yes, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor on slogans such as
'Wish You Could Hear,'
'Love Is All We Need,'
'Kick Out The Jams,'
'Kick Out Your Mother,'
'Cut Up Y
Our Friend,'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End.'
And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above.
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe."
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain,
For I once read a book in which lovers were slain,
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain,
It said:
"I believe in the Power of Good.
I Believe in the State of Love.
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right.
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Ri
Ght to be Right."
And I open my eyes to look around,
And I see a child laid slain on the ground.
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows,
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command.
But not hearing anymore-
Not hearing anymore,
Just the shrieks from the old rich.
And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now',
And I Want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow.
And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live
Live
Live
Live

Maybe I should announce it, should i
Memory of a free festival
The children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the london sky
Resting on our hands
It was god's land
It was ragged and naive
It was heaven
Touch, we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satoria must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall venusians passing through
And peter tried to climb aboard but the captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And we walked back to the road, unchained
The sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, ha ha ha
(Repeat 25 times)
The sun machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party, yeah yeah
The sun machine is coming down, woh ho ho
Sun machine is coming down, oh oh oh ah
Sun machine is coming down, oh

In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know."
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too
So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh It's the madness in his eyes
As he breaks the night to cry
It's really Me
Really You
And really Me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really You
And really Me
You'll lose me though I'm always really free
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud
And the village dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the wild eyed boy from freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand
And the Magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy, said
Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down"
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came trembling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track

Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last
It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
I'm the cream
Of the Great Utopia Dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen
I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm 
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me 
Quite amazed
As I'm unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed
I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me 
Quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your father
Quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd Browning's freak you was.
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
Mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man go
Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed
Diamond Dogs are civilised
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh! Who!
Ooh ...
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Waf waf! Woof woof! Wah wah!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool!
Diamond Dogs rule
OK?
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah. oh
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah, oh

Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car, twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon wish upon day upon day, I believe, oh, Lord
I believe all the way
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
There's my baby, lost that's all

She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright

You love bands when they're playing hard

You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

"Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All night)
But she wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture window (Doo doo doo doo)
She finds the slinky vagabond (Doo doo doo doo)
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak and his type, all for nothing (Doo doo doo doo)
Misses a step and cuts his hand, but (Doo doo doo doo)
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song, she cries
"Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yeah, ah-yeah
(She wants the young American)
All right
(All right)
Well, she wants the young American
All the way from Washington
Her breadwinner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?", well
(All night)
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yes, he does, ah
(He wants the young American)
Mmm mmm mmm
(All right) Well, all right
Well, he wants the young American
Do you remember your President Nixon? (Doo doo doo doo)
Do you remember the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American? (Doo doo doo doo)
Just you and your idol sing falsetto 'bout (Doo doo doo doo)
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor (Doo doo doo doo)
In case, just in case of depression? (Doo doo doo doo)
Sit on your hands on the bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro Sheeners
Ain't that close to love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, ain't that poster love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, it ain't that Barbie Doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and
(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American, young American)
Young American, ah
(You want the young American)
All right, ah
(All right)
You want the young American
You ain't a pimp, and you ain't a hustler
(Young American, young American)
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
(You want the young American)
(All night)
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh, boy)
I got a suite and-ah you got defeat
(All night)
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And ain't there a child I can hold without judging-ah?
(Young American, young American)
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
(All right)
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?
All night
I want the young American
(Young American, young American)
The young American
(I want the young American)
(All right)
All night, I want the young American, young American
(Young American, young American)
I want what you want, I want what you want
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want what I, I want you, you want I, I want, you want
(Young American, young American)
I want what you want, but you want what I want, you
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want I, I want you
And all I want is a young American-ah
(Young American, young American)
A young American, a young American
(I want the young American)
(All night)

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
They'll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell that you're 80, but, brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all-night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for more?)
(More)
I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all-night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)

Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet
Dead roses
Saki and strings divine
You'll make it
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war
Don't fake it
Sadden glissando strings
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell
I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?

Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from ground control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the action man:
"I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following"
The shrieking of nothing is killing just
Pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but this planet is glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing...
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again, I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said...

I'm home, lost my job and incurably ill
You think this is easy realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh no
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I got believers believing me, oh
One more weekend 
Of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers believing me
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no
Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and millions of puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers
I've got believers 
I've got believers
I've got believers in me
I've got believers
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I am a D.J.

There's a brand new dance but I don't know it's name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland, full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here
Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, turn to the right
Ooh, fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me
No, beep-beep
There's a brand new talk but it's not very clear (ooh, bop)
That people from good homes are talking this year (ooh, bop, fashion)
It's loud and it's tasteless, I've not heard it before (ooh, bop)
Shout it while you're dancing on the dance floor (ooh, bop, fashion)
Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, right
Fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me

Wake up, you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
I look out my window, what do I see?
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we work here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain, you got to make way for the Homo superior
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain, you got to make way for the Homo superior

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head
Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?

Hey my love
Goodbye love
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll, "Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound it seemed to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him, too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me, with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

Heaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way
When you're a boy
Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry
When you're a boy
When you're a boy
You can wear a uniform
When you're a boy
Other boys check you out
You get a girl
These are your favourite things
When you're a boy
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out
Uncage the colours
Unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When you're a boy
They'll never clone ya
You're always first on the line
When you're a boy
When you're a boy
You can buy a home of your own
When you're a boy
Learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes for ever and ever
What d'you say?
Du, k√∂nntest du schwimmen
Wie Delphine, Delphine es tun
Niemand gibt uns eine Chance
Doch k√∂nnen wir siegen f√ºr immer und immer
Und wir sind dann Helden f√ºr einen Tag
Ich, ich bin dann K√∂nig
Und du, du K√∂nigin
Obwohl sie unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir Helden f√ºr einen Tag
Wir sind dann wir an diesem Tag
Ich, ich glaubte zu tr√§umen (zu tr√§umen)
Die Mauer im R√ºcken war kalt (so kalt)
Sch√ºsse rei√üen die Luft (rei√üen die Luft)
Doch wir k√ºssen, als ob nichts geschieht (nichts geschieht)
Und die Scham fiel auf ihrer Seite
Oh, wir k√∂nnen sie schlagen f√ºr alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden f√ºr diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Oh oh oh oh

"You know who I am," he said.
The speaker was an angel:
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings,
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going."
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger,
Driven by the night,
Till you come."
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
See it in my eyes
Till you come."
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
Driven by the night,
Till you come"
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
Feel it in my voice,
Till you come."

The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff
From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkhuth
There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stains
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here
Well, it's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here

This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too
Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants so much to
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

Up every evening 'bout a
Half eight or nine I give my
Complete attention to a
Very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a
He's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five

She sat around forlorn
She saw my TVC one five
And baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my

So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
Oh, so demonic, oh my TVC one five

Send back my dream test baby

So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way
Be with my baby, then
We'll spend some time together

There was a time, the laughing time
I took my heart to every party
They'd point my way
"How are you today? "
"Will you make us laugh? chase our blues away? "
Their funny man won't let them down
No, he'd dance and prance and be their clown
That time, the laughing time
When even a fool learns to love
The clown turned around
And saw her smile, oh how she loved me
She'd clap her hands and beg me stay
To make her laugh, to make her life gay
Who wants the love of all the world
When here was love in the eyes of just one girl
That day, that precious day
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love
That day, that hateful day
The joke turned stale, the game was over
Those spiteful words "oh, go away. who wants to play? "
"It's getting late now."
My world, my funny world
Had lost it's mask and shown a broken heart
A time, a sour time
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love

Here comes Johnny yen again

Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand,
Jack is in his coat, and Jane is her vest, and, me,
I'm in a rock'n'roll band. Huh!
Ridin' in a Stutz-Bearcat, Jim
Y'know, those were different times!
Oh, all the poet, they studied rules of verse,
And the ladies, they rolled their eyes.
Sweet Jane! Whoa! Sweet Jane, oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!
I'll tell you something,
Jack, he is a banker,
And Jane, she is a clerk.
Both of them save their monies, ha,
And when, when they come home from work!
Ooh! Sittin' down by the fire, oh!
The radio does play,
The classical music there, Jim.
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers".
All you protest kids.
You can hear Jack say, get ready, ah,
Sweet Jane! Come on baby now! Sweet Jane! Oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!
Some people, they like to go out dancing,
And other peoples, they have to work. Just watch me now!
And there's even some evil mothers,
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt.
Y'know that, women, never really faint,
And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!
And that, y'know, children are the only ones who blush!
And that, life is, just to die!
And, everyone who ever had a heart, oh,
That wouldn't turn around and break it.
And anyone who ever played a part, whoa,
And wouldn't turn around and hate it!
Sweet Jane! Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane.
Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane.
Heavenly wine and roses,
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles. ah,
Heavenly wine and roses,
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles. hey!
La-la-la-la-la-la,
La-la-la-la-la-la,
La-la-la-la-la-la,
La-la-la-la-la-la, oh
Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane!

Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red 
Rich men's children running past 
Their fathers dressed in hose 
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes 
Gazing eyes and running wild 
Past the stocks and over stiles 
Kiss the window merry child 
But come and buy my toys 
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn 
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn 
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill 
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will 
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys 
Leave the parsley on the stalls 
Come and buy my toys 
You shall own a cambric shirt 
You shall work your father's land 
But now you shall play in the market square 
Till you'll be a man 
Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red

The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I'll watch them sink before your gaze
Senjorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love like a ragged soldier
Catching butterflies
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh I'm so much in love like the little boy
Who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

Fingertips sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut furs that hide behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in a tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor 
He's cloaked and clothed in saffran robes, his beads are all he owns
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man
Fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war, a gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been, I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder,
Because the years of threading daisies lie behind you now.
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told.
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and paints and beads.
I will show you games where the winner never wins.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key,
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals.
We shall drink the oldest wine, and velvet skies will linger.
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free.
I will hold a lighted lamp, and we shall walk together.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Your darkened eyes throw mystery,
But your lips are void of history.
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you?
I will give you dreams,
And I'll tell you things you'd like to hear.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Let me sleep beside you.

War made him a soldier 
Little Frankie Mear 
Peace left him a loser 
The little bombardier 
Lines of worry appeared with age 
Unskilled hands that knew no trade 
Spent his time in the picture house 
The little bombardier 
Frankie drank his money 
The little that he made 
Told his woes to no man 
Friendless, lonely days 
Then one day, in the ABC 
Four bright eyes gazed longingly 
At the ice-cream in the hand of 
The little bombardier 
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days 
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze 
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy 
Two young children had changed his aims 
He gave them toffees and played their games 
He brought them presents with every coin he made 
Then two gentlemen called on him 
Asked him for his name 
Why was he friends with the children 
Were they just a game? 
Leave them alone or we'll get sore 
We've had blokes like you in the station before 
The hand of authority said "no more" to 
The little bombardier 
Packed his bags, his heart in pain 
Wiped a tear and caught a train 
Not to be seen in the town again 
The little bombardier

Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door, I'll wave my flag and shout
Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid, it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool
Oh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry
Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Well, I might be able to stretch it till Wednesday

Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand
Rubber Band
In 1910, I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh
Rubber Band
Won't you play your haunting theme again to me?
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
Oh, play that theme
Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in library parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love
Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh
spoken:
Oh sob, I hope you break your baton

La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 
Jack Frost took her hand and left me
Jack Frost ain't so cool 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away 
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday 
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
See my eyes, my window pane 
See my tears like gentle rain 
That's the memory of a summer day 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
La la la la la la (repeat)

She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house.
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
And never took her out.
She wore a trench coat, khaki.
Her hobnail boots were full of holes.
She's got medals.
Her mother called her "Mary," but she changed her name to "Tommy,"
She's a one... oh.
She went and joined the army,
Passed the medical; don't ask me how it's done.
They sent her to the front line,
Fighting for her country's name.
She's got medals.
She got very tired of picking up girls,
Cleaning her gun, and shaving her curls.
Then the enemy dropped a bomb.
Survivors there were none.
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead.
She'd deserted on the previous morning.
Replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green.
Called herself Eileen.
Came to London town.
Now she's settled down.
She's got medals.

Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Potala lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly Boy Blue, blue
Silly Boy Blue
Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly Boy Blue, Blue
Silly Boy Blue
You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die
La la la la la, la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la, la la la la
La la la, la la

Child of Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song

Bow Bells strike another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away
Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you
Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys
You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys
A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, 'cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys

There is a happy land where only children live 
They don't have the time to learn the ways 
Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves 
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite 
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike 
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him 
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us 
Mother calls, but we don't hear 
There's lots more things to do 
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet 
But we will be, very shortly 
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry 
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky 
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away 
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray 
There is a happy land where only children live 
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup

Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 
Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum 
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days 
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me 
Riding on a golden horse 
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you 
Happy at the sound of your voice 
Maybe I'll slay a dragon for you 
Or banish wicked giants from the land 
But you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you 
We will only love each other as forever 
When I live my dream 
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 
And the empty man you left behind 
It's a broken heart that dreams
It's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream 
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 
Wish, and the storm will fade away 
Wish again, and you will stand before me
While the sky will paint an overture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream 
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me 
Let me be the one to understand 
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me 
Then we can live in our new land 
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream...

I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of the Swedish room
Of Hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise
Some things we could do
In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An occasional dream
And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
'Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago, long ago
And I still can't touch your name
For the days of fate were strong for you
Danced you far from me
In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream (time)
Of mine

Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red 
Rich men's children running past 
Their fathers dressed in hose 
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes 
Gazing eyes and running wild 
Past the stocks and over stiles 
Kiss the window merry child 
But come and buy my toys 
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn 
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn 
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill 
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will 
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys 
Leave the parsley on the stalls 
Come and buy my toys 
You shall own a cambric shirt 
You shall work your father's land 
But now you shall play in the market square 
Till you'll be a man 
Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red

I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you that sets the test
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
"I gave Them life, I gave Them all
They drained my very soul dry
I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts to be free?
Words of strength and care and sympathy
I opened doors that would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me"
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you that sets the test
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream
Where all is God and God is just a word
"We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood, we planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers, sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yeah, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor on slogans such as
'Wish You Could Hear'
'Love Is All We Need'
'Kick Out The Jams'
'Kick Out Your Mother'
'Cut Up Your Friend'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'
And We know the Flag of Love is from above
And We can force you to be free
And We can force you to believe"
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
"I believe in the Power of Good.
I Believe in the State of Love.
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right.
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right."
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I Want to believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to believe
There's a light shining through somehow
And I want to believe
And you want to believe
And we want to believe
And we want to live
Oh, we want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
Live
Live
Live

Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah
Don't sit down
Don't sit down
Don't sit down

I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
Then she moved toward the exit, clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart, it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears, the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
Hey

Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand
Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all
You're fey, Janine
A trouper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown
So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang
Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
'Cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang
Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang
This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang

The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do? 
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you
They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well, so do I
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay
He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake? 
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you

This girl is made of lipstick 
Powder and paint 
Sees the pictures of herself 
Every magazine on every shelf 
This girl is maid of Bond Street 
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives 
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs 
This girl is a lonely girl 
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus 
Buys the Daily News 
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her 
This girl is made of loneliness 
A broken heart 
For the boy that she once knew 
Doesn't want to know her any more 
And this girl is a lonely girl 
Every thing she wants is hers 
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with 
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy 
Jealousy 
He doesn't have a limousine 
Really wants to be a star himself 
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor 
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars 
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

The children of the summer's end gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the London sky resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven
Touch, we touched the very soul of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head and away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd and we walked back to the road, unchained
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party

There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot
And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
"Ah-choo, excuse me"
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket
"God, it's pouring down"
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, Oh God
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes my friend
And this one here's for you
"Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain"

Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand
Rubber Band
In 1910, I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh
Rubber Band
Won't you play your haunting theme again to me?
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
Oh, play that theme
Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in library parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love
Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh
spoken:
Oh sob, I hope you break your baton

La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 
Jack Frost took her hand and left me
Jack Frost ain't so cool 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away 
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday 
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
See my eyes, my window pane 
See my tears like gentle rain 
That's the memory of a summer day 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
La la la la la la (repeat)

She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house.
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
And never took her out.
She wore a trench coat, khaki.
Her hobnail boots were full of holes.
She's got medals.
Her mother called her "Mary," but she changed her name to "Tommy,"
She's a one... oh.
She went and joined the army,
Passed the medical; don't ask me how it's done.
They sent her to the front line,
Fighting for her country's name.
She's got medals.
She got very tired of picking up girls,
Cleaning her gun, and shaving her curls.
Then the enemy dropped a bomb.
Survivors there were none.
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead.
She'd deserted on the previous morning.
Replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green.
Called herself Eileen.
Came to London town.
Now she's settled down.
She's got medals.

Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Potala lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule

Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly Boy Blue, Blue
Silly Boy Blue
You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die

Reincarnation of one better man

And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear

There is a happy land where only children live 
They don't have the time to learn the ways 
Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves 
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite 
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike 
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him 
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us 
Mother calls, but we don't hear 
There's lots more things to do 
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet 
But we will be, very shortly 
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry 
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky 
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away 
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray 
There is a happy land where only children live 
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup

Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 
Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum 
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days 
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother

Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last
It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
I'm the cream
Of the Great Utopia Dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen
I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm 
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me 
Quite amazed
As I'm unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed
I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me 
Quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your father
Quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed

Here is the news:
According to the latest world population survey,
Figures have reached danger point, my god!
London: 15 million 75 thousand.
New York: 80 million.
Paris: 15 million and 30.
China: 1000 million.
Billington-Spa: lots!
My studies include exophagy.
I formed my own society,
To crush the power of fecundity.
The world will overpopulate,
Unless you claim infertility.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel 
That they are not infertible.
The crops of few, the cattle gun.
There's only one way to linger on.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
Achtung, achtung! These are your orders:
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air 
Will be slaughtered and cremated.
Only one cubic foot of air is allowed...
I've prepared a document legalising mass abortion.
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide.
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
You don't seem to hear me clear.
Do I talk above your sphere? 
Let me explain my project, dear,
Show you how I'll save the world,
Or let it die within the year.
Why do you look that way at me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
We are hungry men.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to eat you.

Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the wild eyed boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smoulders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh it's the madness in his eyes
As he breaks the night to cry:
It's really me
Really you
And really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you
And really me
You'll lose me though I'm always really free
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realise
Where the snow had saved a place
For the wild eyed boy from Freecloud
And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the wide-eyed boy from Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand
And the magic in the stare
Of the wild eyed boy said
Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face of the wise boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track

Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
They'll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell that you're 80, but, brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all-night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)

I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side

Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet
Dead roses
Saki and strings divine
You'll make it
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war
Don't fake it
Sadden glissando strings
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell
I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?

How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25

Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race

Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex

He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love

And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag
Too many snags
Well, I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed

Big brother
Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulses unreal
We'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
We'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin, we can really begin
Please saviour, save your shores
Tell me I'm rapidly yours
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to save us, someone like you
We want you, Big Brother
Big Brother!
I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone, and you've been anywhere
Lord, I'd take an overdose, if I knew what's going down
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you
Someone to lead us, someone to follow

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

I've seen all the rest of my Hollywood highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff from my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty, 'cause you just got paid
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel 
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head 
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
Please stay
You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since you pinned your baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions, a sack full of cheques
You made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
For a day
Oh yeah
Don't you care?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo!
Oh yeah

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd Browning's freak you was.
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
Mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man go
Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed
Diamond Dogs are civilised
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh! Who!
Ooh ...
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Waf waf! Woof woof! Wah wah!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool!
Diamond Dogs rule
OK?
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah. oh
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah, oh

You're like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with them now for they won't see you no more
Like a gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while, while you look for a whore
Like that sailor leaves, come back again
Stay for a while and they won't see you again
Like that gypsy caravan forever on the run
You stay for a while, then you pick up and go
That's how you show your love for me
That's how you show your love for me
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, leave a little sorrow
You're like that big, big star, he's tore the town apart
Leavin' everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, then you leave without a trace
That's exactly like that star, he tore the town apart
Leave everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, leave without a trace
That's how you show your love for me
That's how you show your love for me
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you call, you leave a little sorrow
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you stay, leave a little sorrow
Uh huh, oh
Here today, gone tomorrow
Hmm yeah
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow, yeah
Here today, here today but gone tomorrow
Thank you, we'll see you soon

I don't wanna lose, the good thing, that I've got
If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot
For your love, is better. than any love other I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock - on wood
Baby
I got superstitious, about you, but I can't take a chance
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock - on wood
Yeah!
It's no secret, but that woman, fills my lovin' cup
She seems, so ready, that I can't get enough
And her love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, it's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock - on wood
Baby!
Better, yes, better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Yes, I better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh, knock on wood
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) You know I would, would
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) It's no secret
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) No, oh, better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Above me
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) I can't leave her
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh no, baby
Knock on wood, WOO!

I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man love is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Freak out
Far out
In out

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
Uh
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe, but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just turn on with me, and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands

You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand
When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!
When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me
Oh, when you rock 'n' roll with me,
There's no one else I'd rather be, oh
Nobody down here can do it for me
When you rock 'n' roll with me
When you rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather, I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears, I'm in tears
When you rock 'n' roll with me

Hey man
Oh, leave me alone, you know
Hey man
Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man
I gotta straighten my face
This mellow-thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man
My schoolday's insane
Hey man
My work's down the drain
Hey man
Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Hey man
Oh Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man
I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man
D-droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Oh, hit me
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Oh, she's all right
My Suffragette City
My Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
Ooh, oh Suffragette City
Ooh, my Suffragette City
Ooh-how, my Suffragette City
Ooh-how, yea
Ah, wham bam thank you ma'am!
My Suffragette City
My Suffragette City - Quite alright
My Suffragette City - Too fine
My Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Suffragette!

It's safe in the city to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and...
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know."
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too
So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Time, he's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy
Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy
Time, in Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think 
Oh God I'm still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed, your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, time!

Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old-fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so
Yeah! It was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! So it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking, the manholes were smoking
Every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played a Tiger Rag
And the villains on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! And I ran to the street, looking for information
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man

Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
They'll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell that you're 80, but, brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all-night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for more?)
(More)
I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all-night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for more?)
(More)
1984

Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal
He'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
He'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin
Then we can really begin
Please saviour, saviour, show us 
Hear me, I'm graphically yours 
Someone to claim us, someone to follow 
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you
We want you, Big Brother, Big Brother
I know you think you're awful square 
But you made everyone and you've been everywhere
Lord, I'd take an overdose if you knew what's going down
Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you
Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool, someone like you
Someone to claim us, someone to follow 
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo 
Someone to fool, someone like you
We want you, Big Brother

I'll make you a deal like any other candidate.
We'll pretend were walking home cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like the street
There is a bar at the end where I could meet you and your friend.
Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
I am having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charles Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys get it here thing.
So you scream out of line
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Anytime?
Tres butch little numberwang "Hey girlie, I want you
When it's good it's really good and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar.
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying till we break up our minds
Till the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands

Brother
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Brother
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Brother
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Brother
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up

Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd Browning's freak you was.
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
Mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man go
Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed
Diamond Dogs are civilised
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh! Who!
Ooh ...
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Waf waf! Woof woof! Wah wah!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool!
Diamond Dogs rule
OK?
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah. oh
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah, oh

spoken:
And in the death,
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare,
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building
High on Poacher's Hill
And red mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City
No more big wheels.
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox -now legwarmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now
The Year of the Diamond Dogs
This ain't rock'n'roll - this is genocide.

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
Uh
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

If you want it, boys, get it here thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain?
Do you think that your face looks the same?
Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a deal, and a taste
It's got claws, it's got me, it's got you

It's safe in the city to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?

If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and...
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

Something kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way
People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today
We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by?
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard
Yet now
We feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly
They tell me "Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far"
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing it's right, knowing it's right
Now I'm hoping someone will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care
But now
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell
And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theater of financiers
Count them, fifty 'round a table
White and dressed to kill
Oh caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the dead

I've nothing much to offer
There's nothing much to take
I'm an absolute beginner
And I'm absolutely sane
As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films
There's no reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true
Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake
Oh we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches
Just like the films
If there's reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true

Oh, show me the way to the next whiskey bar
Oh, don't ask why, no don't ask why
For we must find the next whiskey bar
Oh, if we don't find the next whiskey bar
I tell you we must die

I tell you, I tell you

Oh, moon of Alabama, it's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey, oh, you know why
Oh, moon of Alabama, it's time to say goodbye

Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25
Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude 
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
Now Jimmy's looking sweet though he dresses like a queen
He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love
We can love
And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag
Too many snags
Well, I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes

Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from ground control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the action man:
"I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following"
The shrieking of nothing is killing just
Pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but this planet is glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing...
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again, I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said...

Weaving down a by-road
Singin' the song
That's my kind of high road
Gone wrong
My-my
Smile at least
You can't say no to
The Beauty and the Beast
Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong
But darling something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside here
Someone could get skinned
How?
My-my
Someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Darling
My-my
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Liebling
My-my
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should
My-my
Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank God Heaven left us
Standing on our feet
My-my
Beauty and the Beast
My-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Darling
My-my
My
My-my

Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely

You
You walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
Your scalding face
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
Too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands
Get me to a doctor's I've been told
Someone's back in town
The chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence
And my honour's at stake
The weather's grim ice on the cages
Me I'm Robin Hood and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming
If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
In the rain
Get me to the doctor
Get me off the streets (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Get me off the streets
Get some protection
Get me on my feet
While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure
To the blackout
Get me on my feet
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets (get some protection)

Baby, I've been
Breaking glass in your room again
Listen 
Don't look at the carpet
I drew something awful on it
See
You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems
I'll never touch you

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing
I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China girl?
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down
I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
And I could pretend nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says, "shh"
She says
She says
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame
(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(Get me some, fame)
(Now get-ah, fame)

Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people
And all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice cream parlour
Drinking milk shakes, cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years

(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
Don't let me hear you say life's
Taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come, get up, my baby)
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come, get up, my baby)
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car, twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon wish upon day upon day, I believe, oh, Lord
I believe all the way
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
I'll stick with you, baby, for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I wanna be free
Don't you wanna be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But moondust will cover you
Cover you
This chaos is killing me
So bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
Bye bye, love
Yeah, bye bye, love
This chaos is killing me
Hallo spaceboy, you're sleepy now

Cover you
And the chaos is killing me
Yeah, bye bye, love
So, bye bye, love

Oh, she's a tongue twisting storm
Comes to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey, not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on the 'lectric dream
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
Then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're the Spiders From Mars
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
C'mon
Come on, come on
Really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
Come on, come on

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Just for one day

Johnny's in America, no tax at the wheel

Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms, tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all
Let's sway
You could look into my eyes
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms and tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song we're playing

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

Shaky hand

Little wonder then

It's all in the tablets
Sneezy Bhutan
Little wonder then

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong

Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

Stone love, she kneels before the grave
A brave son, who gave his life to see the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love, a boy and girl are talking
New words, that only they can share in
New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in it's choosing, sweeping over 'cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving
Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love, and how my God on high is
All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him
Love is careless in it's choosing, sweeping over 'cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving

Hey my love
Goodbye love
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll, "Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound it seemed to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him, too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock 'n' roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star
Get it all, yeah
Ooh, yeah
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd come on like a regular superstar
I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star
Get it all, yeah
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd come on like a regular superstar
I could fall asleep at night as a rock 'n' roll star
I could fall in love all right as a rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star

The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff
From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkhuth
There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stains
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here
Well, it's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here

This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too
Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants so much to
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

Up every evening 'bout a
Half eight or nine I give my
Complete attention to a
Very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a
He's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
I brought my baby home, she
She sat around forlorn
She saw my TVC one five
And baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my
She crawled right in my
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
Oh, so demonic, oh my TVC one five
Maybe if I pray every
Each night I sit there pleading
Send back my dream test baby
She's my main feature
My TVC one five, he
He just stares back unblinking
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way
Be with my baby, then
We'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
My baby's in there someplace

Mmm num ba dah
Dum bum ba beh
Doo buh dum ba beh beh
Pressure
Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you
No man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Mmm ba ba beh
Mmm ba ba beh
Bee de dah
Ee deh da, that's okay
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "let me out"
Pray tomorrow
Gets me higher
Pressure on people
People on streets
Deh deh dep
Mmm, mmm
Dah dah dah bah buh
Okay
(Ooh) Chipping around
Kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days
It never rains, but it pours
Ee do ah buh
Ee dah buh bah bop
Mmm do bop

People on streets
Dee dah dee dah deh
People on streets
Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
Pressure on people
People on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence, but it don't work
Keep coming up with love, but it's so slashed and torn
Why? Why? Why?
(Love)
Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love?
'Cause love's such an old fashioned
Word and love dares you to care for
The people on the edge (People on streets) of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure

You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes
So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do
What in the world can you do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
Oh
I'm just a little bit afraid of you
Cause love won't make you cry
But, wait until the crowd goes
Oh, Wait until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you
So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do
What in the world can I do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
Oh, what you gonna say?
Oh, what you gonna do?
Ah, what you gonna be?
To be real me, to the real me
Under the cool, under the cool and under having a ball
What you gonna say to the real me, to the real me
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me, with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

And I say to myself
I've got it wrong, wrong, wrong
She is a play-girl
She the wrong wrong girl for me
And I say to myself
You're a fool, fool, fool
She doesn't love you
She doesn't need you, this I know
She's got a trail of men that she takes
Wherever she goes
She hasn't the strength to love any single man for a length of time
(And I say to myself)
Ooh, I don't stand a chance
(And I say to myself)
It's a long long romance
(And I say to myself)
Well, she's out to slay
(And I say to myself)
Well, she's got it made
(And I say to myself)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
(And I say to myself)
Oh yeah
And I say to myself that she shouldn't love anybody else in the world but me
And I say to myself
Forget her now, now, now
She don't want you
She don't love you anymore
And I say to myself you're a fool, fool, fool
She's don't love you
She don't need you, this I know
And I turn around and look at myself
You'll never get her, you're a fool
Say after me I'm a fool- I'm a fool
(And I say to myself)
I can't get what I want
(And I say to myself)
And it makes me sad

I can't get what I want

Ooh, I gotta take her
(Baby loves that way)
Yep, I love her
Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy
(Baby loves that way)
Oh, I love my baby
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh, she does too much to me
(Baby loves that way)
And I can't think too much of her
(Baby loves that way)
Gotta take her, gotta take her
Gonna better leave her alone, put you down son
Treating her real fine, thus I'm home being a loner
Jeanny's my babe and that's alright, yeah
She treats me good, each and every night
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy
(Baby loves that way)

Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She clings around with all the boys, who treat her like unwanted toys
(Baby loves that way)
Obviously this is the end
(Baby loves that way)
Gotta take her
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh yeah
(Baby loves that way)
Can't do enough
(Baby loves that way

La la la la la la la la (etc.)
Gather you all and listen here
I'll tell you a tale if you lend me an ear
I rode a horse through many a town
But the devil rode me down to the ground
I was to marry a very rich girl
I loved her as only I can
But the father was shot and his gold was stoled
And now I'm the devil's man, na na na
And now I sing a tale of woe
Through the bars of the county jail, na la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la (etc.)
I walked into the room one night
I found her mother and gun
Well, the man was dead and I kneeled and cried
The sheriff ran in and said "I'm holding you, son"
La la la la la la la la (etc.)
Through the day I sing and play
For time is on my side
But when the moon and stars come out
I lay me down and cry
For the Saviour, mar I lied
Now I will not have a ride
Beside the window the scaffold was made
On the morrow I will hang...
La la la la la la la la (etc.)

Question time
That says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
Mother says
That she can't stand the neighbours' talking
I've gotta pack my bags
Leave this home, start walking, yeah
I'm guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Remember when
We used to go to church on Sundays
I lay awake at night
Terrified of school on Mondays
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends always be found
And I can't
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Now I leave them all
In the Never-Never Land
The station seems so cold
The ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name,
"Hi Dave.
Drop in, see you around, come back
If you're this way again."
Oh, I'm on my own
I've got a long, long way to go
I hope I make it on my own
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

Two by two, they go walking by
Hand in hand, they watch me cry

Lonely nights, I dream you're there
Morning sun and you're gone

Well, I'm glad I've got nobody
Yes, I'm glad I've got nobody
Oh, I'm glad I've got nobody
To be loved by me
All the world couldn't take your place
Another girl, another face
Wouldn't be the type of thing
Know I've found it out and see
Another girl standing next to me
Oh no, just you
Oh no, just you
Well, I couldn't find another you
Everywhere I go, I see your name

Everywhere I go, it's just the same

I've got the village I love
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't know a thing
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig
I feed the lions in Trafalgar Square and I dig everything
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug
Everything
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig
I've got more friends than I've had hot dinners
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything
Dig
I've made myself at home
I've made good friends which the time-check girl on the end of the phone
All the movie shows
I sunbathe for love
Even when it's not too hot
'Cause I dig everything
Oh yeah

You can go where you may
But I'll follow you
Wherever you go
Just turn around and you know

'Cause I'll follow you
Wherever you go
Just turn around and you know

See you strong in the failing light
Just as strong, late at night
You can't lose my trail on you
Just you try, just you try
See me now, lost me now

Just turn around and you know
I'll be waiting there
Duh-dum-duh-dum

Yes, I've read the morning papers
Telling me that you've made money
Do you think I'm gonna crawl, then think again
Though I'm dressed in rags, I'm richer
Though I eat from tins, I'm healthier
Though I live in slums, I'm purer than you, my friend
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend
Look around and see the friends
The ones you left, our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you
Don't look down your nose at me
'Cause I won't ask your sympathy
I won't be your yes-sir man for anything
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend
I would walk with you
Talk with you, drink with you
If you drop that halo that you're wearing on the ground
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend
I can't get my satisfaction
Knowing you won't get reaction
What makes me the big attraction anyway
It's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend
Too bad, I'm not losing sleep

Back to my baby
Back to where they need me

You think you're gonna please her
So you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her
'Cause you're playing with the spider who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my-oh-my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes
Or she'll throw you right off her hook
Here's the news- you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Take my tip- get on out
Take my tip- get on out
You can't give all you got to take something back
Before she'll put you right up on her rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip- get on out
Take my tip- get on out
You think you're gonna please her
So you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
You're scared to walk beside her
'Cause you're playing with the tiger who possess the sky
She got the green backs, my-oh-my
You gotta act tall, think big, if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead, get a car, fancy clothes
Or she'll throw you right off her hook
Here's the news- you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Get it off, take my tip
Get it off, take my tip
You can't give all you have to take something back
Before she'll put you right up on the rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip- get on out
Take my tip- get on out
Take my tip- get on out
Take my tip- get on out

I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way
Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
I thought my day would come
When I would be
The only one
I thought my day would come
Under the moon
And under the sun
Now I shout through all the streets today
Lucky me, your love has come my way
Now tell me I was a fool
Up where the moon is shining so brightly
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
I believe that dreams come through
I believe, because of you
He who made the stars in the sky
Made the world for you and I
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way
Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

You've got a habit of leaving me
And you've got a habit of deserting me
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I'm so sad
Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad
You could go on if you wanted to, wanted to, wanted to
Wanted to
Oh
If you wanted to, yeah
Oh huh
You've got a habit of leaving me
And you've got a habit of deserting me
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I'm so sad
Sometimes I'm so glad, so glad
You could go on if you wanted to, wanted, wanted to
Wanted to, ooh yeah, yeah
Oh, if you wanted to
If you wanted to, yeah, yeah

My, my, the time do fly
When it's in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For I've never been a winner in my life
I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh, it's the animal in me
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand
And I'll walk you through the doors
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
My, my, but time do fly
When it's in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For I've never been a sinner, la di da
Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back 
In Atlantic City
There's not even a demon 
In Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise 
As I walk down the aisle?
And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone 
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Two young men 
Dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad-tempered child 
On a rain slicked street
And I'm gone gone gone
And I'm older than movies
Oh, let me dance, babe
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone
Through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man

Are you OK?
You've been shot in the head
And I'm holding your brains
The old woman said
So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky
See nothing at all
The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the yoga zone
Turn to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
It's nothing at all
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you

Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes

Nothing ever goes away

Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress

See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You come to me with tears and blame

Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it, when he came to us
That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale
So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below
When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress
Only sky, a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness
And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield
To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed
Baal survived it, he just used his eyes
And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room
"Space enough" said Baal, "then I'll thicken the ground
Space enough within this woman's womb"
Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
It's the man who practices it, he can't abide
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much
Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you
Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep
Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup
When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
He'll just have enough sky when he's dead
Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with us

It was a day in that blue month September
Silent beneath the plum trees' slender shade
I held her there
My love, so pale and silent
As if she were a dream that must not fade
Above us in the shining summer heaven
There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon
It was quite white and very high above us
Then I looked up
And found that it had gone
And since that day, so many moons in silence
Have swum across the sky and gone below
The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood
And if you ask, how does that love seem now
I must admit, I really can't remember
And yet I know what you are trying to say
But what her face was like, I know no longer
I only know I kissed it on that day
As for the kiss, I long ago forgot it
But for the cloud that floated in the sky
I know that still and shall forever know it
It was quite white and moved in very high
It may be that the plum trees still are blooming
That woman's seventh child may now be there
And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes
When I looked up
It vanished on the air

Sickened by sun, with rainstorms lashing him rotten
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten
Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there
Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades
You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed
Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans
Though his mother has given him up for lost
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition
Always in search of that land where life seems best
Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises
Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises
With a blue sky overhead and nothing else

If a woman's hips are ample
Then I want her in the hay
Skirt and stocking all a rample
Cheerfully
For that's my way
If the woman bites in pleasure
Then I wipe it clean with hay
My mouth, her lap together
Thoroughly
For that's my way
If the woman goes on loving
When I feel too tired to play
I'd smile and go off waving
Amiably
For that's my way

Once she had drowned and started her slow descent
Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh, the open sky shone most magnificent 
As if it was acting as her body's guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip
And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts
First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpse-choked rivers just one more corpse

Wow, this ain't the right thing to do
So, so let, so let's go
Young girls they know what they're after
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang reach for the sky
I keep a good friend on videotape
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight
Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang sun don't shine
Bang Bang you all angels
Bang Bang now you all ought to be in pictures
Oh girl
Oh girl my problems can't follow me
Phone calls I take my machine
I wander lonely to the sea
Lonely-Ha Ha Ha-what does it mean
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang and you are next in line
Bang Bang reach for the sky
Bang Bang sun don't shine
Rise buildings
Rise to the sky
Well young girls they know what they're after
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Bang bang
Then you close, then you should close, then you close down 
You big man
Bang Bang
Spot the brack
Just come in first
Bang Bang
If praise had wings
Bang Bang
And you next in line

Blue Jean, I just met a girl named Blue Jean
Blue Jean, she got a camouflaged face and no money
Remember, they always let you down when you need 'em
Oh, Blue Jean, is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean?
She got a police bike
She got a turned up nose
Sometimes I feel like (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me (Oh, somebody send me)
One day, I'm gonna write a poem in a letter
One day, I'm gonna get that faculty together
Remember that everybody has to wait in line
For Blue Jean, look out world, you know I've got mine
She got Latin roots
She got everything
Sometimes I feel like (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Sometimes I feel like (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody somebody (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me (Oh, somebody send me)

Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing
I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China girl?
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down
I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
And I could pretend nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says, "shh"
She says
She says
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh

Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Day-in, ooh ooh
Day-out, ooh ooh ooh
She was born in a handbag, love left on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup, nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey, try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Day-in, ooh ooh
Day-out, ooh ooh ooh
First thing she learns is she's a citizen,
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Someone rings a bell and it's all over
She's going out her way
Stealing for that one good rush
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
She could use a little money
She's hangin' on his arms like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey, she's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night, big town, police, shake down
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
She's got a ticket to nowhere
She's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name
She's in the pocket of a home boy
Ooh she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow
Spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make them well aware
She's an angry gal
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Suddenly there's angels everywhere
Angels in a ton of sound
And they shootin' her down
Shootin' her with video-drugs-bullets and promises

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame
(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(Get me some, fame)
(Now get-ah, fame)

There's a brand new dance but I don't know it's name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland, full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here
Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, turn to the right
Ooh, fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me
No, beep-beep
There's a brand new talk but it's not very clear (ooh, bop)
That people from good homes are talking this year (ooh, bop, fashion)
It's loud and it's tasteless, I've not heard it before (ooh, bop)
Shout it while you're dancing on the dance floor (ooh, bop, fashion)
Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, right
Fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Just for one day

So messed up I want you here
And in my room I want you here
And now we're gonna be face to face
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place
Yeah you know what that is
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
(C'mon) (I want to be your dog you know it)
Ooh give it to me
Now I'm ready to close my eyes
Yes now I'm ready to close my mind
Now I'm ready to feel your hands
Lose my heart on the burning sand
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
(C'mon) (I want to be your dog you know it)
Do it
Yeah that's right
So messed up I want you here
And in my room I want you here
And now we're gonna be face to face
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place
Yeah you know what that is
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
Now I want to be your dog
(C'mon) (I want to be your dog you know it)
Well come on
I'll be your dog.

Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms, tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all
Let's sway
You could look into my eyes
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms and tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song we're playing
Let's sway
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight
Let's dance

Watching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're traveling the holy land
Opening telegrams oh ho
Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind oh ho
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan
Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays oh ho
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail oh ho
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear oh ho
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
You pray till the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you'll believe you're loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
Believeing the strangest things (loving the alien)

I know when to go out
I know when to stay in
Get things done
I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try, I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try, I try
Never gonna fall for
(Modern love) Walks beside me
(Modern love) Walks on by
(Modern love) Gets me to the church on time 
(Church on time) Terrifies me
(Church on time) Makes me party
(Church on time) Puts my trust in God and man
(God and man) No confessions
(God and man) No religion
(God and man) I don't believe in modern love
It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try, I try
Never gonna fall for
(Modern love) Walks beside me
(Modern love) Walks on by
(Modern love) Gets me to the church on time 
(Church on time) Terrifies me
(Church on time) Makes me party
(Church on time) Puts my trust in God and man
(God and man) No confessions
(God and man) No religion
(God and man) Don't believe in modern love
(Modern love) Walks beside me
(Modern love) Walks on by
(Modern love) Gets me to the church on time 
(Church on time) Terrifies me
(Church on time) Makes me party
(Church on time) Puts my trust in God and man
(God and man) No confessions
(God and man) No religion

When I believed in nothing I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place I called her name
And though my days were slipping by
And nights so cruel I thought I'd die
She danced her little dance till it made me cry
She was shakin' like this honey doing that
When I needed soul revival I called your name
When I was falling to pieces I screamed in pain
Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real swept over me
You danced your little dance till it made me cry
You were shakin' like this honey doing that
Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down
When all your faith is failing Call my name
When you've got nothing coming Call my name
I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head till the bad stuff breaks
I'll dance my little dance till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that
Never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
Oh no

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
Uh
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

Sons of the silent age
Stand on platforms blank looks and note books
Sit in back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cell's dimensions
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done
Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
Pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
Don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
They never die, they just go to sleep one day
Baby, I won't ever let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Oh baby, baby, baby, I won't ever let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's take another way in (sons of sound and sons of sound)
(Sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, baby, fire away!

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

Time, he's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy
Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy
Time, in Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think 
Oh God I'm still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed, your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, time!

White light - White light gonna drive me out of my brain
White light - White light gonna make me feel so insane
White heat - White heat shapin' them down to my toes
White light - White light's got it now, goodness knows
White light - White light gonna drive me out of my mind
White light - White light's surely gonna make me blind
White heat - White heat shaping way down to my toes
White light - White light could kill me now, goodness knows

White light's a-flashing

Still feels right
What's that sound, what's that sound
Don't turn on, be dead or alive
No feeling
Here she comes
Oww, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) here she comes
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All night)
But she wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture window (Doo doo doo doo)
She finds the slinky vagabond (Doo doo doo doo)
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak and his type, all for nothing (Doo doo doo doo)
Misses a step and cuts his hand, but (Doo doo doo doo)
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song, she cries
"Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yeah, ah-yeah
(She wants the young American)
All right
(All right)
Well, she wants the young American
All the way from Washington
Her breadwinner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?", well
(All night)
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yes, he does, ah
(He wants the young American)
Mmm mmm mmm
(All right) Well, all right
Well, he wants the young American
Do you remember your President Nixon? (Doo doo doo doo)
Do you remember the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American? (Doo doo doo doo)
Just you and your idol sing falsetto 'bout (Doo doo doo doo)
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor (Doo doo doo doo)
In case, just in case of depression? (Doo doo doo doo)
Sit on your hands on the bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro Sheeners
Ain't that close to love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, ain't that poster love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, it ain't that Barbie Doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and
(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American, young American)
Young American, ah
(You want the young American)
All right, ah
(All right)
You want the young American
You ain't a pimp, and you ain't a hustler
(Young American, young American)
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
(You want the young American)
(All night)
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh, boy)
I got a suite and-ah you got defeat
(All night)
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And ain't there a child I can hold without judging-ah?
(Young American, young American)
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
(All right)
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?
All night
I want the young American
(Young American, young American)
The young American
(I want the young American)
(All right)
All night, I want the young American, young American
(Young American, young American)
I want what you want, I want what you want
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want what I, I want you, you want I, I want, you want
(Young American, young American)
I want what you want, but you want what I want, you
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want I, I want you
And all I want is a young American-ah
(Young American, young American)
A young American, a young American
(I want the young American)
(All night)

I've nothing much to offer
There's nothing much to take
I'm an absolute beginner
And I'm absolutely sane
As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films
There's no reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true
Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake
Oh we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches
Just like the films
If there's reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true

Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from ground control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the action man:
"I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following"
The shrieking of nothing is killing just
Pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but this planet is glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing...
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again, I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said...

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing
I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China girl?
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down
I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
And I could pretend nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says, "shh"
She says
She says
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh

(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
Don't let me hear you say life's
Taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come, get up, my baby)
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come, get up, my baby)
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car, twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon wish upon day upon day, I believe, oh, Lord
I believe all the way
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
I'll stick with you, baby, for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

Stinking weather fat
Shaky hand
Dopey morning Doc
Grumpy gnomes
Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you
Big screen dolls
Tits and Explosions
Sleepy time
Bashful but nude
Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you
Enter galactic
See me to be you
It's all in the tablets
Sneezy Bhutan
Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you
Mars happy nation
Sit on my karma
Dame meditation
Take me away
Little wonder then
Little wonder
You little wonder
Little wonder you
Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
Little wonder
You little wonder you
Little wonder
You little wonder you
Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
Little wonder, you little wonder you
Little wonder, you little wonder you
You little wonder, little wonder you
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
Uh
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too
Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants so much to
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me, with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind
And wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

5:15
I'm changing trains - this little town - let me down
This foreign rain brings me down
5:15
Train overdue
Angels have gone
No ticket
I'm jumping tracks
I'm changing time
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore only you
5:15
All of my life, Angels have gone
I'm changing trains
Angels like them thin on the ground
All of my life
All legs and wings
Swings turn the eyes
5:15
Train overdue
Angels have gone
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore only you
Cold station all of my life
Forever I fear

Please don't tear this world asunder
Please take back this fear we're under
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you
Please make sure we get tomorrow
All this pain, all this sorrow
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you
Give my children sunny smiles
Give them warm and cloudless skies
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
I might just stop loving you, loving you
When you talk
We talk too
When you walk
We walk too
From factory to field
How many tears must fall
Down here below
Nothing is moving
I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop needing you
I might just stop loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
For I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you
Loving you, loving you
I demand a better future

I wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me
But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown
And I'm still so afraid
Yes, I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid on my own
On my own
What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds
If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile
Then I won't feel afraid
No, I won't feel afraid
I won't be, be afraid
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?
I miss your kissin' and I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
Just run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet and send it to me
I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you di yi yi yi yine
D -A -V -I -D
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
So bloody your hands on the cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore

Said you'd took a big trip, they said you moved away
Happened oh so quietly, they say
Should've took a picture, something I could keep
Buy a little frame, something cheap
For you
Everyone says "Hi"
Said you sailed a big ship, said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing to say
I'd love to get a letter, like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good and it's not too hot
For you
Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says "Hi"
If the money is lousy
You can always come home
We can do all the old things (doo wap wap wha ooh)
We can do all the bad things (doo wap wap)
If the food gets you leery
You can always phone
We could do all the old things (doo wap wap wha ooh)
We could do it, we could do it, we could do it (doo wap wap ooh)
Don't stay in a bad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says "Hi" (everyone says "Hi")
And the girl next door (everyone says "Hi")
And the guy upstairs (everyone says "Hi")
Everyone says "Hi" (everyone says "Hi")
And your mum and dad (everyone says "Hi")
Everyone says "Hi" (everyone says "Hi")
And your big fat dog (everyone says "Hi")
Everyone says "Hi" (everyone says "Hi")

Steel on the skyline
Sky made of glass
Made for a real world
All things must pass
Waiting for something
Looking for someone
Is there no reason?
Have I stared too long?
You say you'll leave me
And when the sun is low
And the rays high
I can see it now
I can feel it die

Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
(Sigh)
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And boy, I really felt blue
Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars
The winding stream
Moon shining down
On some little town
And with each beam
The same old dream
I took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
Well I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
Pulled down my sun visor
Boy, I really felt blue
You jumped into your Gemini
I jumped into mine
We'll orbit the Moon
For just one time
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Will you hold hands
With me under the moonlight
Took a trip in a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I took, I took a walk in space
Boy, I really felt blue
Well I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back
The stardust trail
Leading back to you
What did I do
What could I do
What did I do
Well
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And thought about you

Walking in the snowy street
Let me understand
Drifting down a silent path
Stumbling over land
Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave
Do you sleep in quietude
Do you walk in peace
Do you laugh out loud at me
No one else is free
Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave
I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand
I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are
Open up your heart to me
I would be your slave
I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand
I would give you all my love
Nothing else is free
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave

Oogie waits for just another day
Drags his bones to see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers grey
Oh, they slip away
Once a time they nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away
Don't forget to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world in war torn
How I wonder where you are
Oh-ooh
Sailing over Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are
Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982
The joke we always knew
What'sa matter with you
C'mon, let's go
Slip away
Don't forget to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world inwar torn
How I wonder where you are
Oh-ooh
Sailing over Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are

Here shall we live in this terrible town
Where the price for our eyes shall squeeze them tight like a fist
And the walls shall have eyes
And the doors shall have ears
But we'll dance in the dark
And they'll play with our lives
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round
But who are we
So small in times such as these
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Oh, these are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights
These are the darkest to fall
But who knows?
Echoes in tenement halls
Who knows?
Though the years snare them all
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Twirling us round and round and upside down
There's fear overhead
There's fear overground
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round
And here are we
At the center of it all
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Slow Burn

Nothing remains
We could run when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
(First voice)
In your fear
Of what we have become
Take to the fire
Now we must burn
All that we are
Rise together
Through these clouds
As on wings
(2nd voice)
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love
In your fear, in your fear
As on wings
Oh
Woo
This is the trip
And this the business we take
This is our number
All my trials, Lord
Will be remembered
Everything has changed

Wood jackson
- CD single: Slow Burn
- CD single: Everyone Says 'Hi' (part 1)
Jackson made twenty tapes in a day
To give away
A give away
And he play
The tunes they'd call creative when they're running out of names
Heaven knows he's really torn it now
But the names it hurt poor jackson stopped the haters in his way
Heaven knows he's for it
Sha-a-a-me!
Hey hey
He was never quite unsure but really sane
Wants to play
Jackson stole twenty souls in a day
To take away
A take away
He takes away
And no complaints
Heart's upon his sleeve and his blade
Wood jackson took the beating every day, given out, passed away, another way
Hey hey
Just wants to play
And how he played
The mob they bleed and tremble when they're running after life
Heaven knows he's really torn it now
The words that killed Wood jackson's friends were written on the wall
Heaven knows he's for it
Shame!
Just wants to play
It's a shame
Shame
It's a shame
Wants to play
It's a shame
It's a shame
Just wants to play

Weaving down a by-road
Singin' the song
That's my kind of high road
Gone wrong
My-my
Smile at least
You can't say no to
The Beauty and the Beast
Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong
But darling something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside here
Someone could get skinned
How?
My-my
Someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Darling
My-my
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Liebling
My-my
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should
My-my
Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank God Heaven left us
Standing on our feet
My-my
Beauty and the Beast
My-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Darling
My-my
My
My-my

You
You walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
Your scalding face
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
Too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands
Get me to a doctor's I've been told
Someone's back in town
The chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence
And my honour's at stake
The weather's grim ice on the cages
Me I'm Robin Hood and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming
If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
In the rain
Get me to the doctor
Get me off the streets (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Get me off the streets
Get some protection
Get me on my feet
While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure
To the blackout
Get me on my feet
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets (get some protection)

Du
K√∂nntest du schwimmen
Wie Delphine
Delphine es tun
Niemand gibt uns eine Chance
Doch k√∂nnen wir siegen
F√ºr immer und immer
Und wir sind dann Helden
F√ºr einen Tag
Ich
Ich bin dann K√∂nig
Und du
Du K√∂nigin
Obwohl sie
Unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir Helden
F√ºr einen Tag
Wir sind dann wir
An diesem Tag
Ich
Ich glaub' das zu tr√§umen (Zu tr√§umen)
Die Mauer
Im R√ºcken war kalt (So kalt)
Sch√ºsse rei√üen die Luft (Rei√üen die Luft)
Doch wir k√ºssen
Als ob nichts geschieht (Nichts geschieht)
Und die Scham fiel auf ihre Seite
Oh, wir k√∂nnen sie schlagen
F√ºr alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Just for one day

Moi, je souhaiterais que tu nages
Comme les dauphins, les dauphins savent nager
Bien que rien nous gardera ensemble
Nous les vaincrons, les vaincrons √† jamais
On pourrait √™tre h√©ros pour jusqu'un journ√©e
Moi, je serai un roi
Et toi, tu seras ma reine
Bien que rien, que rien ne les chassera
On pourra √™tre h√©ros pour jusqu'un journ√©e
On pourrait √™tre nous pour jusqu'un journ√©e
Je, je me rappelle (je me rappelle)
Debout, pr√®s du mur (pr√®s du mur)
Les gardes tirant au-del√† de nous (au-del√† de nous)
Et on s'embrassait comme si rien ne tombait (rien ne tombait)
Et la honte √©tait de l'autre c√¥t√©
Oh nous les vaincrons, nous les vaincrons √† jamais
On pourra √™tre h√©ros pour jusqu'un journ√©e
On peut √™tre un h√©ros
On peut √™tre un h√©ros
On peut √™tre un h√©ros pour jusqu'√† jamais
On peut √™tre un h√©ros

Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he said
"Tell you who you are if you nail me to my car"
Boy
Thanks for hesitating
This is the kiss off
Boy
Thanks for hesitating
You'll never know the real story
Just a couple of dreams 
You get up and sleep
You can buy god it's Monday
Slither down the greasy pipe
So far so good no one saw you
Hobble over any freeway
You will be like your dreams tonight
You get up and sleep
You get up and sleep
Joe the lion
Made of iron
Joe the lion
Went to the bar
A couple of drinks on the house an' he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are"
Joe the lion, yeah yeah
Went to the bar, yeah yeah
A couple of dreams and he was
A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car tell you who you are"
You get up and sleep
The wind blows on your check
The day laughs in your face
Guess you'll buy a gun
You'll buy it secondhand
You'll get up and sleep
Joe the lion made of iron (repeat ad inf.)

Sons of the silent age
Stand on platforms blank looks and note books
Sit in back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cell's dimensions
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done
Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
Pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
Don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
They never die, they just go to sleep one day
Baby, I won't ever let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Oh baby, baby, baby, I won't ever let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's take another way in (sons of sound and sons of sound)
(Sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, baby, fire away!

The secret life of Arabia
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green
I was running at the speed of life
Through morning's thoughts and fantasies
Then I saw your eyes at the cross fades
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green
The secret life of Arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green
The secret life of Arabia
You must see the movie the sand in my eyes
I walk through a desert song when the heroine dies
Arabia (secret secret)
Arabia (secret)
Arabia (secret secret)
Arabia
Arabia (secret secret)
Arabia
Arabia (secret secret)
Arabia
Arabia (secret secret)
Arabia
Arabia (secret secret)
The secret life of Arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green

Was she never there
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time
Oh ho
Oh ho
Oh ho
Oh ho
All the flowers so
From the gallery
With the hymns of night
Singing come to me
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time
Oh ho
Oh ho
Was she never here
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life
Was she ever
Was she ever here
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life away
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life, away (oh ho)
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life, away (oh ho)
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life, away (oh ho)
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life, away (oh ho)
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho

New angels of promise (do do do do)
We despair
We are the dead dreams (oh ho ho ho)
We take the blame
Take us to the edge of time
Take us to the edge of time
We are the fabulous lovers
I'm a blind man and she's my eyes
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, it's always time
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, it's always time
New angels of promise (do do do do) we despise
(Do do do do) Don't fall apart now
(Ah ho ho ho) We are the silent ones
Take us to the edge of time
Take us to the edge of time
We are the tabular lovers
We listen to the storm
Suspicious nights
You didn't feel us coming in this lonely crowd, it's always time
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, it's always time
New angels of promise, we despair
We are the dead dreams (ah ho ho ho)
We take the blame
Take us to the egde of time
Take us to the edge of time
We are the fabulous lovers
I am a blind man and she is my eyes
Suspicious mind
You didn't feel us coming in this lonely crowd, it's always time
Supicious minds
You didn't feel us coming in this lonely crowd, it's always time
Supicious minds
You didn't feel us coming in this lonely crowd, it's always time
It's always time
It's always time
It's always time

I forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we lay upon your bed
A city full of flowers
A city full of rain
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I don't regret anything at all
I remember how we wept
On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
The gods forgot they made me
So I forget them too
I listen to the shadows
I play among their graves
My heart was never broken
My patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Seven

Your coat and hat are gone
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don't look me in the eye
We lay in each other's arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we've lived it out
Something in the air
We smiled too fast then can't think of a thing to say
Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Nothing left to save
Let's take what we can
I know you'll hold your head up high
We've raged for the last time
A place of no return
And there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
Yea
Something in the air
Something in my eye
Abracadoo, I lose you
We can't avoid the clash, the big mistake
Now we're gonna pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go
We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you
Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Say what you will
There's something in the air
Raged for the last time
But I know you'll hold your head up high
There's nothing we have to say
There's nothing in our eyes
But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
There's something I have to say
There's something in the air
Something in my eye
Doo-doo-doo doo doo
Doo-doo-doo doo doo
I've danced with you too long
Doo-doo-doo doo doo
Doo-doo-doo doo doo
Danced with you too long
Doo doo
Danced with you too long
Something in the air
Something in the air
Doo-doo doo doo
Doo-doo doo doo

Oh my, naked eyes
I should have kept you
I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
I miss you
Give me wings
Give me space
Give me money for a change of face
Those noisy rooms and passion pants
I love you
Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right?
Who said 'time is on my side'?
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive
You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive
Beatle boys, all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs, every night
Wish I'd sent a Valentine
I love You
I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
My naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
I'll Survive

Black eyed ravens
They spiral down
They tilt his head back
To the flame filled sunset
Raise their guns high
As the darken falls
These are the days boys
Shallow man
Shallow man (shallow man) and they
Eats in the doorways with his head inclined
And he's always in decline
No one hears anymore
So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermilion skies
So it goes (so it goes)
Just a searcher (so it goes)
Lonely soul (so it goes)
The last of the dreamers (so it goes)
Shallow man
Shallow man
Speaks to the shadows
Moves his trembling hands
And he's always a little late
For the dawning of the day
So it goes (so it goes)
Just a searcher (so it goes)
Lonely soul (so it goes)
The last of the dreamers (so it goes)
(So it goes) Just a searcher
(So it goes) Lonely soul
(So it goes) The last of the dreamers (so it goes)
(So it goes) Just a searcher
(So it goes) Lonely soul
(So it goes) The last of the dreamers (so it goes)
(So it goes)
(So it goes)
(So it goes)
(So it goes)

What to wear, what to say
What to do on a sunny day
Who to phone, who to fight
Who to dance with on a Sunday night?
Reaching the very edge you know
Reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side of this town
Reaching the very edge
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bit and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell
Well, I am a drug, I am a dragon
I am your best jazz you've ever seen
I am the dragon, I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets, I found gold
I found you out before you grow old
I found you out before you grow old
What is eternal, what is damned
What is clay and what is sand?
Who to dis, who to trust
Who to listen to and who to suss?
I'm reaching the very edge you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side of this town
I'm reaching the very edge
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bit and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell
I am a dragon, I am a drug
I am your best jazz you've ever had
I am the dragon, I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets, I found gold
I found you out before you grow old
I found you out before you grow old
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out
But they wore it well
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out
But they wore it well
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out
But they wore it well
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out
But they wore it well
You're still breathing but you don't know why, we got
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hell

All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same
Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Now that I've really got a chance
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Everything's falling into place
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Seeing my past to let it go
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's Child
(Oh, whoa)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was (x2)
Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and Lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet
Lucky old sun is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms
(Oh-neh don' go)
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Now that I've really got a chance
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Everything's falling into place
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Seeing my past to let it go
(Yeah, throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I

Skeletal city highs
Crazies with dumb replies
Nobody's eyes anymore
Frown on your beggar's face
Walking this lunarscape
Nothing in my lackaday
We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes
Somebody's space to rent
Somebody's soul to dent
Dog is in every word
Hiding the flames of power
Hiding us home by home
Nearly got out yesterday
We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes
Trouble it travels on the wing
Doorway to door
Open your eyes
Nothing remains
A secret love between us
Nothing can hide for long
We are the morning song
Holding my breath anyway
We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes
We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes
Through it sometimes
(We all go through)
Through it sometime
(We all go through)
(We all go through)
(We all go through)

Grown inside a plastic box
Micro thoughts and safety locks
Hearts become outdated clocks
Ticking in your mind
Now it's time to close our eyes
Now it's time to say goodbye
Now it's time to face the lie
That we'd never cry
What's really happening, what tore us apart
What's really happening
What's really happening, what tore us apart
What's really happening
All the clouds are made of glass
And they're slowly sinking
Falling like the shattered past
Were we built to last?
What's really happening, what tore us apart
What's really happening
What's really happening, what tore us apart
What's really happening
Now it's time to close our eyes
Now it's time to say goodbye
Now it's time to face the lie
That we'd never cry
What's really happening, what tore us apart
What's really happening

{This is Andy Warhol and it's take one, take one
It's, it's Warhol actually
What did I say?
Whole, it's whole as in wholes
Aa, Andy Warhol
Wah, Andy Warhol, Andy Warhol
Like whole hub
Andy Warhol like what?
He, ha
Are you ready?
Yeah, ha ha ha}
Like to take a cement fix 
Be a standing cinema 
Dress my friends up just for show 
See them as they really are 
Put a peephole in my brain 
Two new Pence to have a go
Like to be a gallery 
Put you all inside my show
Andy Warhol looks a scream 
Hang him on my wall 
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen 
Can't tell them apart at all
Andy walking, Andy tired 
Andy take a little snooze 
Tie him up when he's fast asleep 
Send him on a pleasant cruise 
When he wakes up on the sea 
Sure to think of me and you 
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do
Andy Warhol looks a scream 
Hang him on my wall 
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen 
Can't tell them apart at all

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

The tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
The mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They've opened shops down West side
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky

Fill your heart with love today   
Don't play the game of time 
Things that happened in the past
Only happened in your mind
Only in your mind, ah, forget your mind
And you'll be free, yeah   
The writing's on the wall
Free, yeah 
And you can know it all
If you choose 
Just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure 
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind
And makes it free
Free
Oh, happiness is happening
Dragons have been bled
Gentleness is everywhere
Fear's just in your head
Only in your head
Fear is in your head
Only in your head
So forget your head
And you'll be free
The writing's on the wall
Free, yeah, and you can know it all
If you choose 
Just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love will clean your mind
And make you free
Free, yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Free, yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Free, yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Free, yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Free, yeah

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people when they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us, you're gonna be pretty kookie, too
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching
Other people's dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

Wake up, you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
I look out my window, what do I see?
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we work here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain, you got to make way for the Homo superior
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain, you got to make way for the Homo superior

I'm up on the eleventh floor 
And I'm watching the cruisers below 
He's down on the street 
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement 
My weekend's at an all time low 
'Cause she's hoping to score 
So I can't see her letting him go 
Walk out of her heart 
Walk out of her mind 
Oh, not her
She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that
Oh yeah
She's an old-time ambassador of sweet talking, night walking games
Oh and she's known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it, then she can do it
She don't make false claims 
But she's a queen, and such are queens, that your laughter is sucked in their brains 
Now she's leading him on 
And she'll lay him right down 
Yes, she's leading him on 
And she'll lay him right down 
But it could have been me 
Yes, it could have been me 
Why didn't I say? Why didn't I say?
No, no, no 
She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that 
So I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold, it don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah, I lay down a while and I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street so I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab 'cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth and it's no taste at all
It could have been me, oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say
No, no, no 
She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that

Oh, hear this, Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
His words of truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more
Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
You gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on the wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising
We'd rather be scared
Together than alone
Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Now hear this, Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So we're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity
Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Ah, a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Oh, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes

And so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like they hope it was
And the Goodmen Tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of Brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighing, the swirl through the streets
Like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our Wings that Bark
Flashing teeth of Brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, And we were Gone
Hanging out with your Dwarf Men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions
I was Stone and he was Wax
So he could scream, and still relax, unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Through our veins and Lo! it was midnight
Back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today
And it was Stalking time for the Moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
In the Devil-may-be-here
But He can't sing about that
Oh, And we were Gone
Real Cool Traders
We were so Turned On
You thought we were Fakers
Now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The Factor Max that proved the fact
Is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
Now my Brother lays upon the Rocks
He could be dead, He could be not
He could be You
He's Chameleon, Comedian, Corinthian and Caricature
Shooting-up Pie-in-the-Sky
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the Bad
Bewlay Brothers
In the Blessed and Cold
In the Crutch-hungry Dark
Was where we flayed our Mark
Oh, and we were Gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so Turned On
In the Mind-Warp Pavilion
Lay me place and bake me Pie
I'm starving for me Gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked
I might just slip away, hey
Just for the Day, Hey!
Hey, Please come Away, Hey!
Just for the Day, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey!
Just for the Day
Please come Away
Please come Away
Please come Away
Please come Away
Away
(Away)
Away
Hey

Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red 
Rich men's children running past 
Their fathers dressed in hose 
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes 
Gazing eyes and running wild 
Past the stocks and over stiles 
Kiss the window merry child 
But come and buy my toys 
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn 
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn 
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill 
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will 
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys 
Leave the parsley on the stalls 
Come and buy my toys 
You shall own a cambric shirt 
You shall work your father's land 
But now you shall play in the market square 
Till you'll be a man 
Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red

Did you ever have a dream or two
Where the hero is a guy named you
And the things he does are just too much
Does he fly like Mr. Superman, speak Chinese, French and Dutch?
And did you ever have a dream or two?
Have you ever woken up one day
With the feeling that you'd been away?
If the girl that you dreamed of last night
Had the same dream, in the very same scene
With the very same boy, hold tight
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge
I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If you've got the secret, tell me do
Have you ever had a dream or two?
Have you ever had a dream or two?

The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I'll watch them sink before your gaze
Senjorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love like a ragged soldier
Catching butterflies
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh I'm so much in love like the little boy
Who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang
Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
'Cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang
Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang
This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang

Fingertips sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut furs that hide behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in a tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor 
He's cloaked and clothed in saffran robes, his beads are all he owns
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man
Fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war, a gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been, I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder,
Because the years of threading daisies lie behind you now.
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told.
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and paints and beads.
I will show you games where the winner never wins.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key,
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals.
We shall drink the oldest wine, and velvet skies will linger.
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free.
I will hold a lighted lamp, and we shall walk together.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Your darkened eyes throw mystery,
But your lips are void of history.
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you?
I will give you dreams,
And I'll tell you things you'd like to hear.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Let me sleep beside you.

War made him a soldier 
Little Frankie Mear 
Peace left him a loser 
The little bombardier 
Lines of worry appeared with age 
Unskilled hands that knew no trade 
Spent his time in the picture house 
The little bombardier 
Frankie drank his money 
The little that he made 
Told his woes to no man 
Friendless, lonely days 
Then one day, in the ABC 
Four bright eyes gazed longingly 
At the ice-cream in the hand of 
The little bombardier 
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days 
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze 
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy 
Two young children had changed his aims 
He gave them toffees and played their games 
He brought them presents with every coin he made 
Then two gentlemen called on him 
Asked him for his name 
Why was he friends with the children 
Were they just a game? 
Leave them alone or we'll get sore 
We've had blokes like you in the station before 
The hand of authority said "no more" to 
The little bombardier 
Packed his bags, his heart in pain 
Wiped a tear and caught a train 
Not to be seen in the town again 
The little bombardier

Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door, I'll wave my flag and shout
Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid, it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool
Oh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry
Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Well, I might be able to stretch it till Wednesday

This girl is made of lipstick 
Powder and paint 
Sees the pictures of herself 
Every magazine on every shelf 
This girl is maid of Bond Street 
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives 
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs 
This girl is a lonely girl 
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus 
Buys the Daily News 
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her 
This girl is made of loneliness 
A broken heart 
For the boy that she once knew 
Doesn't want to know her any more 
And this girl is a lonely girl 
Every thing she wants is hers 
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with 
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy 
Jealousy 
He doesn't have a limousine 
Really wants to be a star himself 
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor 
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars 
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot
And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
"Ah-choo, excuse me"
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket
"God, it's pouring down"
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, Oh God
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes my friend
And this one here's for you
"Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain"

Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand
Rubber Band
In 1910, I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh
Rubber Band
Won't you play your haunting theme again to me?
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
Oh, play that theme
Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in library parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love
Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh
spoken:
Oh sob, I hope you break your baton

La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 
Jack Frost took her hand and left me
Jack Frost ain't so cool 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away 
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday 
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
See my eyes, my window pane 
See my tears like gentle rain 
That's the memory of a summer day 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
La la la la la la (repeat)

She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house.
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
And never took her out.
She wore a trench coat, khaki.
Her hobnail boots were full of holes.
She's got medals.
Her mother called her "Mary," but she changed her name to "Tommy,"
She's a one... oh.
She went and joined the army,
Passed the medical; don't ask me how it's done.
They sent her to the front line,
Fighting for her country's name.
She's got medals.
She got very tired of picking up girls,
Cleaning her gun, and shaving her curls.
Then the enemy dropped a bomb.
Survivors there were none.
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead.
She'd deserted on the previous morning.
Replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green.
Called herself Eileen.
Came to London town.
Now she's settled down.
She's got medals.

Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Potala lanes

A chela likes to feel

You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die

The gospel according to Tony Day (x3)
If I find a girl he'll take her away
Rotten Tony
The gospel according to Brendan O'Lear (x3)
If I buy him a scotch he'll buy me a beer
Tight fist, friends
The gospel according to Pat Hewitt (x3)
If it's written on a sweater then I'd better not do it
Gotta gotta, your mind, blow it, blow it
The gospel according to Marianne Brent (x3)
She'll be mine if I pay the rent
Good old Marianne, who needs friends, oh
Waste of flippin' time, take a look at my life and you'll see
Take a quick, butchers, rotten Harry down the hall
Wouldn't give me tuppence for him

I was walking down the high street,
When I heard footsteps behind me.
And there was a little old man (
Hello!
)
In scarlet and gray, chuckling away
Well he trotted back to my house
And he sat beside the telly (
Ah!
)
With his tiny hands on his tummy
Chuckling away, laughing all day
"I ought to report you to the Gnome Office."
"Gnome Office? Ahahahah!"
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me,
Said the laughing gnome
Well I gave him roasted toadstools,
And a glass of dandelion wine. (
*burp* Pardon...
)
Then I put him on a train to Eastbourne.
Carried his bag, and gave him a fag.
"Have you got a light, boy?"
"Here, where do you come from?"
"Gnome-man's land, heehee!"
"Oh, really?"
In the morning, when I woke up,
He was sitting on the edge of my bed,
With his brother, whose name was Fred.
He'd brought him along to sing me a song.
"All right, let's hear it... 'ere, what's that clicking noise?"
"That's Fred, he's a metro-gnome, haha!"
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
"Oh now, I'm a gnome, anyway, haha!"
"Haven't you got a home to go to?"
"No, we are gnome-ads, hehe!"
"Didn't they teach you to get your hair cut at school? You look like a rolling gnome."
"Nah, not at the London school of Eco-gnome-ics."
Now they're staying up me chimney,
And we're living on caviar and honey (
Hurray!
)
'Cause they're earning me lots of money
Writing comedy prose for radio shows
"It's the, errrr... it's the gnome-service, yes, of course!"
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
(Oh, dear me...)
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
(
One more time!
)
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me

Bow Bells strike another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away
Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you
Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys
You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys
A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, 'cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys

There is a happy land where only children live 
They don't have the time to learn the ways 
Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves 
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite 
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike 
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him 
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us 
Mother calls, but we don't hear 
There's lots more things to do 
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet 
But we will be, very shortly 
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry 
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky 
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away 
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray 
There is a happy land where only children live 
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup

Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 
Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum 
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days 
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother

Here is the news:
According to the latest world population survey,
Figures have reached danger point, my god!
London: 15 million 75 thousand.
New York: 80 million.
Paris: 15 million and 30.
China: 1000 million.
Billington-Spa: lots!
My studies include exophagy.
I formed my own society,
To crush the power of fecundity.
The world will overpopulate,
Unless you claim infertility.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel 
That they are not infertible.
The crops of few, the cattle gun.
There's only one way to linger on.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
Achtung, achtung! These are your orders:
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air 
Will be slaughtered and cremated.
Only one cubic foot of air is allowed...
I've prepared a document legalising mass abortion.
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide.
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
You don't seem to hear me clear.
Do I talk above your sphere? 
Let me explain my project, dear,
Show you how I'll save the world,
Or let it die within the year.
Why do you look that way at me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
We are hungry men.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to eat you.

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me 
Riding on a golden horse 
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you 
Happy at the sound of your voice 
Maybe I'll slay a dragon for you 
Or banish wicked giants from the land 
But you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you 
We will only love each other as forever 
When I live my dream 
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 
And the empty man you left behind 
It's a broken heart that dreams
It's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream 
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 
Wish, and the storm will fade away 
Wish again, and you will stand before me
While the sky will paint an overture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream 
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me 
Let me be the one to understand 
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me 
Then we can live in our new land 
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream...

Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it, when he came to us
That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale
So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below
When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress
Only sky, a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness
And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield
To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed
Baal survived it, he just used his eyes
And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room
"Space enough" said Baal, "then I'll thicken the ground
Space enough within this woman's womb"
Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
It's the man who practices it, he can't abide
Vices have their point, once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much
Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you
Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep
Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup
When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
He'll just have enough sky when he's dead
Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale
Naked, young, immensely marvellous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with us

It was a day in that blue month September
Silent beneath the plum trees' slender shade
I held her there
My love, so pale and silent
As if she were a dream that must not fade
Above us in the shining summer heaven
There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon
It was quite white and very high above us
Then I looked up
And found that it had gone
And since that day, so many moons in silence
Have swum across the sky and gone below
The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood
And if you ask, how does that love seem now
I must admit, I really can't remember
And yet I know what you are trying to say
But what her face was like, I know no longer
I only know I kissed it on that day
As for the kiss, I long ago forgot it
But for the cloud that floated in the sky
I know that still and shall forever know it
It was quite white and moved in very high
It may be that the plum trees still are blooming
That woman's seventh child may now be there
And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes
When I looked up
It vanished on the air

Sickened by sun, with rainstorms lashing him rotten
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten
Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there
Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades
You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed
Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans
Though his mother has given him up for lost
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition
Always in search of that land where life seems best
Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises
Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises
With a blue sky overhead and nothing else

If a woman's hips are ample
Then I want her in the hay
Skirt and stocking all a rample
Cheerfully
For that's my way
If the woman bites in pleasure
Then I wipe it clean with hay
My mouth, her lap together
Thoroughly
For that's my way
If the woman goes on loving
When I feel too tired to play
I'd smile and go off waving
Amiably
For that's my way

Once she had drowned and started her slow descent
Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh, the open sky shone most magnificent 
As if it was acting as her body's guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip
And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts
First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpse-choked rivers just one more corpse

See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long
Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name
Well, you've been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long
Still, this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
Well, it's been so long
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire with gasoline
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
Well, it's been so long
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out fire with gasoline
(Been so long)
(Been so long) Well, it's been so long
(Been so long) I've been putting out fire
(Been so long) Ooh, it's been so long
(Been so long) Been putting out fire
(Been so long) It's been so long
(Been so long) I'm putting out fire
(Been so long)
Been so long (So long, so long)
Been so long (So long, so long)
Been putting out fire (Been so long, so long, so long)
Been putting out fire (Been so long, so long, so long)
Been so long
(Been so long, so long, so long)
(Been so long, so long, so long) Been putting out fire
(Been so long, so long, so long) Been putting out fire
(Been so long, so long, so long) Been so long
Been so long (Been so long, so long, so long)
Been so long (Been so long, so long, so long)

Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing
I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China girl?
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down
I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
And I could pretend nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says, "shh"
She says
She says
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh

You never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that is at
I guess I recognise your destination
I think I see beneath your make-up
What you want is so separation
This is no ordinary, this is no ordinary
(Oh, oh, oh) What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys
You've got a very heavy reputation
But no one knows about your low life
I know a way to find a situation
And hold a candle to your high life disguise
You caught me kneeling at your sister's door
That was no ordinary stick-up
I'm well aware just what you're looking for
I am no ordinary, I am no ordinary
(Oh, oh, oh) What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys
Baby-faced boys
Baby-face
What a criminal world
What a criminal
Criminal
What a criminal world
What a criminal
Criminal

Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms, tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all
Let's sway
You could look into my eyes
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms and tremble like a flower
Let's dance

I know when to go out
I know when to stay in
Get things done
I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try, I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try, I try
Never gonna fall for
(Modern love) Walks beside me
(Modern love) Walks on by
(Modern love) Gets me to the church on time 
(Church on time) Terrifies me
(Church on time) Makes me party
(Church on time) Puts my trust in God and man
(God and man) No confessions
(God and man) No religion
(God and man) I don't believe in modern love
It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try, I try
Never gonna fall for
(Modern love) Walks beside me
(Modern love) Walks on by
(Modern love) Gets me to the church on time

Like weeds on a rock face waiting for the scythe 
Ricochet, ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs 
Ricochet, ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten?
And who can bear to be forgotten?
March of flowers, March of Dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep
Dreaming of tram-lines, factories, pieces of machinery
Mine shafts, things like that
March of flowers, March of Dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the Devil breaking parole
Ricochet, it's not the end of the world
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the Devil breaking parole
Ricochet, ricochet
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent, new way 
Ricochet, ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten?
And who can bear to be forgotten?
March of flowers, March of Dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Early, before the sun, they struggle off to the gates
In their secret, fearful places, they see their lives unraveling before them
March of flowers, March of Dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the Devil breaking parole
Ricochet, it's not the end of the world
That's when they get home, damp-eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For, who can bear to be forgotten?

(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
I feel like a sailboat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So, when you gonna phone me
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
But I'll take you to New York
It's the place that I know well
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
And I'm wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well
Duck and I sway (What's my line?)
I shoot at a full moon (What's my line?)
So what's my line?
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, ooh
'Cause love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'd fight for you
You're better than money
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Oh, when I'm feeling disconnected, well, I sure know what to do
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
I'll shake it, baby
I'll shake it, shake it
I'll duck and I'll sway (What's my line?)
I'll shoot at a full moon (What's my line?)
So what's my line?
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it
(Shake it, shake it, what's my line?)
Shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, baby

Mmm num ba dah
Dum bum ba beh
Doo buh dum ba beh beh
Pressure
Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you
No man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Mmm ba ba beh
Mmm ba ba beh
Bee de dah
Ee deh da, that's okay
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "let me out"
Pray tomorrow
Gets me higher
Pressure on people
People on streets
Deh deh dep
Mmm, mmm
Dah dah dah bah buh
Okay
(Ooh) Chipping around
Kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days
It never rains, but it pours
Ee do ah buh
Ee dah buh bah bop
Mmm do bop
Beh la
People on streets
Dee dah dee dah deh
People on streets
Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming "let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
Pressure on people
People on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence, but it don't work
Keep coming up with love, but it's so slashed and torn
Why? Why? Why?
(Love)
Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love?
'Cause love's such an old fashioned
Word and love dares you to care for
The people on the edge (People on streets) of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life are gone
I look into your eyes
There's no smoke without fire
You're exactly who I want to be with
Without you, what would I do?
And when I'm willing to call it a day
Just when I won't take another chance
I hold your hand
There's no smoke without fire
Woman, I love you
Without you, what would I do?

Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
They'll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell that you're 80, but, brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all-night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for more?)
(More)
I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side
I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all-night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (Who could ask for more?)
1984 (Who could ask for more?)
(More)
1984

Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet
Dead roses
Saki and strings divine
You'll make it
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war
Don't fake it
Sadden glissando strings
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell
I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane
You'll make it
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?

Big brother
Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulses unreal
We'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
We'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin, we can really begin
Please saviour, save your shores
Tell me I'm rapidly yours
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to save us, someone like you
We want you, Big Brother
Big Brother!
I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone, and you've been anywhere
Lord, I'd take an overdose, if I knew what's going down
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us - some brave Apollo!
Someone to save us, someone like you
We want you Big Brother
Chant of the ever-circling skeletal family
Brother!
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Brother!
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Brother!
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Brother!
Ooh-ooh
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro ...

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

I've seen all the rest of my Hollywood highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff from my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty, 'cause you just got paid
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel 
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head 
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
Please stay
You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since you pinned your baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions, a sack full of cheques
You made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
For a day
Oh yeah
Don't you care?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo!
Oh yeah

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd Browning's freak you was.
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
Mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man go
Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed
Diamond Dogs are civilised
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh! Who!
Ooh ...
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Waf waf! Woof woof! Wah wah!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool!
Diamond Dogs rule
OK?
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah. oh
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah, oh

You're like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with them now for they won't see you no more
Like a gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while, while you look for a whore
Like that sailor leaves, come back again
Stay for a while and they won't see you again
Like that gypsy caravan forever on the run
You stay for a while, then you pick up and go
That's how you show your love for me
That's how you show your love for me
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you come, leave a little sorrow
You're like that big, big star, he's tore the town apart
Leavin' everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, then you leave without a trace
That's exactly like that star, he tore the town apart
Leave everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, leave without a trace
That's how you show your love for me
That's how you show your love for me
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you call, you leave a little sorrow
You're like
Here today, gone tomorrow
Each time you stay, leave a little sorrow
Uh huh, oh
Here today, gone tomorrow
Hmm yeah
You're like

Each time you come, you leave a little sorrow, yeah
Here today, here today but gone tomorrow
Thank you, we'll see you soon

I don't wanna lose, the good thing, that I've got
If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot
For your love, is better. than any love other I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock - on wood
Baby
I got superstitious, about you, but I can't take a chance
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock - on wood
Yeah!
It's no secret, but that woman, fills my lovin' cup
She seems, so ready, that I can't get enough
And her love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, it's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock - on wood
Baby!

(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Above me
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) I can't leave her
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh no, baby
Knock on wood, WOO!

I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
Uh
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe, but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just turn on with me, and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands

You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand
When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!
When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me
Oh, when you rock 'n' roll with me,
There's no one else I'd rather be, oh
Nobody down here can do it for me
When you rock 'n' roll with me
When you rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather, I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears, I'm in tears
When you rock 'n' roll with me

Hey man
Oh, leave me alone, you know
Hey man
Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man
I gotta straighten my face
This mellow-thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man
My schoolday's insane
Hey man
My work's down the drain
Hey man
Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Hey man
Oh Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man
I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man
D-droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Oh, hit me
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Oh, she's all right
My Suffragette City
My Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
Ooh, oh Suffragette City
Ooh, my Suffragette City
Ooh-how, my Suffragette City
Ooh-how, yea
Ah, wham bam thank you ma'am!
My Suffragette City
My Suffragette City - Quite alright
My Suffragette City - Too fine
My Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Suffragette!

It's safe in the city to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and...
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know."
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too
So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Time, he's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy
Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy
Time, in Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think 
Oh God I'm still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed, your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, time!

Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old-fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so
Yeah! It was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! So it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking, the manholes were smoking
Every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played a Tiger Rag
And the villains on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! And I ran to the street, looking for information
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man

{This is Andy Warhol and it's take one, take one
It's, it's Warhol actually
What did I say?
Whole, it's whole as in wholes
Aa, Andy Warhol
Wah, Andy Warhol, Andy Warhol
Like whole hub
Andy Warhol like what?
He, ha
Are you ready?
Yeah, ha ha ha}
Like to take a cement fix 
Be a standing cinema 
Dress my friends up just for show 
See them as they really are 
Put a peephole in my brain 
Two new Pence to have a go
Like to be a gallery 
Put you all inside my show
Andy Warhol looks a scream 
Hang him on my wall 
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen 
Can't tell them apart at all
Andy walking, Andy tired 
Andy take a little snooze 
Tie him up when he's fast asleep 
Send him on a pleasant cruise 
When he wakes up on the sea 
Sure to think of me and you 
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do
Andy Warhol looks a scream 
Hang him on my wall 
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen 
Can't tell them apart at all

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people
And all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice cream parlour
Drinking milk shakes, cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years

Oh, she's a tongue twisting storm
Comes to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey, not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on the 'lectric dream
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
Then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're the Spiders From Mars
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
C'mon
Come on, come on
Really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man
Hey white boy, what you doin' in town
Hey white boy, chasin' all the women around
Oh pardon me, sir, it's the last thing on my mind
I'm just looking for a good friend of mine
I'm waiting for the man
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Real shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for the man
Big dirty building, up three flights of stairs
Nobody stops you 'cause nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Then you gotta split because he's got no time to waste
I'm waiting for the man
Baby, don't you holler, darlin', don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow but that's just another time
I'm waiting for the man
I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man
Waiting for the man
To welcome me home

Well, Annie's pretty neat
She always eats her meat
And Joe is awful strong
Bet your life he's puttin' us on
Oh, lordy 
Oh, lordy
You know I need some lovin'
I'm movin'
Touch me
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing
Oh, shadow love was quick and lean
Life's a well-thumbed machine
I saw you watchin' from the stairs
You're everyone that ever cared
Oh, lordy
Oh, lordy
You know I need some lovin'
I'm movin'
Touch me

Ooh

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man love is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Freak out
Far out
In out

My death waits like an old "rou√©"
So confident I'll go his way
Whistle to him and the passing time...
My death waits like a bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
We drank for that - and the passing time...
My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as our love is bright
Let's not think of that or the passing time...
But whatever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do...
Angel or devil, I don't care
For in front of that door... there is you.
My death waits like a beggar blind
Who sees the world through an unlit mind
Throw him a dime for the passing time...
My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
Let's not think about the passing time
My death waits there between your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Let's not think about the passing time...
But what ever lies behind the door,
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil I don't care
For in front of that door... There is you
My death waits there among the leaves
In magician's mysterious sleeves
Rabbits and dogs and the passing time...
My death waits there among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow cowers
Let's pick lilacs for the passing time...
My death waits there, in a double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
Let's not think about the passing time...
But whatever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil... I don't care
For in front of that door
There is... me

I'm up on the eleventh floor 
And I'm watching the cruisers below 
He's down on the street 
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement 
My weekend's at an all time low 
'Cause she's hoping to score 
So I can't see her letting him go 
Walk out of her heart 
Walk out of her mind 
Oh, not her
She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that
Oh yeah
She's an old-time ambassador of sweet talking, night walking games
Oh and she's known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it, then she can do it
She don't make false claims 
But she's a queen, and such are queens, that your laughter is sucked in their brains 
Now she's leading him on 
And she'll lay him right down 
Yes, she's leading him on 
And she'll lay him right down 
But it could have been me 
Yes, it could have been me 
Why didn't I say? Why didn't I say?
No, no, no 
She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that 
So I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold, it don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah, I lay down a while and I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street so I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab 'cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth and it's no taste at all
It could have been me, oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say
No, no, no 
She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe, but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just turn on with me, and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands

"Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
"Ground Control to Major Tom (10, 9, 8, 7, 6)
Commencing countdown, engines on (5, 4, 3, 2)
Check ignition and may God's love be with you (1, lift off)
"This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare"
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
"For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
"Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much" - "She knows.
"Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do"

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with superfear 
Their endless tragic lives
Could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity
Wondrous beings chained to life
Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries
Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh
A chance to die
To turn to mold
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies

In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know."
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too
So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

African nightmare, one-time Mormon
More men fall in hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman, I went too far
Bent on a windfall, rent a Sony
Wonder how the dollar went down

Hey ho, he wished me well

Bare strip takeoff, skimming over rhino

Struggle with a child whose screaming, dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life, quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one left unnamed
Seems like another day, I could fly
Into the eye of God on high
Seems like another day, I could fly
Into the eye of God on high
Over the bushland, over the trees
Wise like orangutan, that was me

Life is a pop of the cherry

These are your favourite things
When you're a boy

I'm home, lost my job and incurably ill
You think this is easy realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh no
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I got believers believing me, oh
One more weekend 
Of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers believing me
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around

Can't turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no
Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and millions of puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers
I've got believers 
I've got believers
I've got believers in me
I've got believers
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I am a D.J.

In the event that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion and we never get old
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable, too.
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
It's a very modern world, but nobody is perfect
It's a moving world, but that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we?
And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember it's true, a loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable, too.
We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
But any sudden movement, and I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?

Let's say goodbye till tomorrow
With a word sincere
How do you make it through the night?
I hope to God you're still here, I pray Ol√©
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
I pray Ol√©
It's a God eat God world, it's a dog's tomorrow
And the song and the wind
Brings nothing but sorrow
I pray Ol√©, I pray Ol√©, I pray Ol√©
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?
Can you make it through?
Can you make, can you make it through?

"You know who I am," he said.
The speaker was an angel:
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings,
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going."
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger,
Driven by the night,
Till you come."
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
See it in my eyes
Till you come."
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
Driven by the night,
Till you come"
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
Feel it in my voice,
Till you come."

Sometimes I feel
That I need to move on
So I pack a bag
And move on
Move on
Well I might take a train
Or sail at dawn
Might take a girl
When I move on
When I move on
Somewhere, someone's calling me
And when the chips are down
I'm just a travelling man
Maybe it's just a trick of the mind
And somewhere there's a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild
Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground
Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that
Somewhere, someone's calling me
And when the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you
Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Oh, can you feel it in the way
That a man is not a man?
Can you see it in the sky
That the landscape is too high?
Like a nervous disease
And it's been there all along
It will tumble from the sky
It's been there all along

Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through you
When you ask him how the kids are
He'll get home around seven
'Cause the Chevy's real old
And he could have had a Cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne
With the blue silk blouse
And the food is on the table
But the food is cold
Don't hit her
"Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working
When you can't damn cook?"
Well Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes
Shows through
And he could have married Anne
With the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne
With the blue silk blouse
Shows through
Shows through

Yassassin - I'm not a moody guy
Yassassin - I walk without a sound
Yassassin - just a working man, no judge of men
Yassassin - but such a life I've never known
We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away
Yassassin - I'm not a moody guy
Yassassin - I walk without a sound
Yassassin - just a working man, no judge of men
Yassassin - but such a life I've never known
Look at this - no second glances
Look at this - no value of love
Look at this - just sun and steel
Look at this - then look at us
If there's someone in charge
Then listen to me
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cause I've got a love
And she's afeared
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away
Yassassin - I'm not a moody guy
Yassassin - I walk without a sound
Yassassin - just a working man, no judge of men
Yassassin - but such a life I've never known

Every chance
Every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
I was always looking
Left and right
Always crashing in the same car
Jasmine, I saw you peeping
As I put my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to ninety-four
But I'm always crashing in the same car

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head
Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?

You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes
So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do
What in the world can you do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
Oh
I'm just a little bit afraid of you
Cause love won't make you cry
But, wait until the crowd goes
Oh, Wait until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you
So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do
What in the world can I do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love

Oh, what you gonna say?
Oh, what you gonna do?
Ah, what you gonna be?
To be real me, to the real me
Under the cool, under the cool and under having a ball
What you gonna say to the real me, to the real me
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Just then grandfather came out. He was angry because Peter had gone in the meadow. "It is the dangerous place. If a wolf should come out of the forest, then what would you do?"
But Peter paid no attention to his grandfather's words. Boys like Peter aren't afraid of wolves.
But grandfather took Peter by the hand, locked the gate and led him home.

Meanwhile, Peter made a lasso and carefully letting it down and down and down, caught the wolf by the tail and pulled with all his might.
Feeling himself caught, the wolf began to jump wildly trying to get loose.
But Peter tied the other end of rope to the tree, and the wolf's jumping only made the rope round his tail tighter.

In the meantime, Peter, without the slightest fear, stood behind the gate watching all that was going on.
He ran home, got a strong rope, and climbed up the high stone wall.
One of the branches of the tree around which the wolf was walking stretched out over the wall.
Grabbing hold of the branch, Peter lightly climbed over on to the tree.

Peter said to the bird: "Fly down and circle over the wolf's head. Only take care that he doesn't catch you."
The bird almost touched the wolf's head with his wings while the wolf snapped angrily at him, this side and that.
How that bird teased the wolf! And how the wolf wanted to catch him! But the bird was clever, and the wolf simply couldn't do anything about it.

On a branch of a big tree sat a little bird, Peter's friend. "All is quiet, All is quiet" chirped the bird gaily. Yes all is quiet.

Just then a duck came waddling round. She was glad that Peter hadn't closed the gate and decided to take a nice swim in the deep pond in the meadow.
Seeing the duck, the little bird flew down upon on the grass, settled next to her and shrugged his shoulders.
"What kind of bird are you if you can't fly?" said he. To this the duck replied "What kind of bird are you if you can't swim?" and dived into the pond.
They argued and argued, the duck swimming in the pond and the little bird hopping along the shore.
Suddenly, something caught Peter's attention. It was a cat crawling through the grass.
The cat thought: "The bird is busy arguing, I'll just grab him". Stealthily she crept towards him on his velvet paws.
"Look out!" shouted Peter and the bird immediately flew up into the tree, while the duck quacked at the cat, from the middle of the pond. The cat walked around the tree and thought, "Is it worth climbing up so high? By the time I get there the bird will have flown away."

And then he got her and with one gulp swallowed her.

Just then the hunters came out of the woods, following the wolf's trail and shooting as they went.

But Peter, sitting in the tree, said: "Don't shoot! Birdie and I have already caught the wolf. Now help us take him to the zoo."
Now just imagine, just imagine the triumphant procession. Peter at the head. After him the hunters leading the wolf. And winding up the whole procession grandfather and the cat.
Grandfather shook his head discontentedly. "Well, if Peter hadn't caught the wolf? What's then?"
Above them flew Birdie chirping merrily. "My, what brave fellows we are, Peter and I! Look what we have caught!"
And if one would listen very carefully, he would hear the duck quacking inside the wolf, because the wolf, in his hurry, had swallowed her alive.

Early one morning, Peter opened the gate and went out into the big green meadow.

And now, this is how things stood: the cat was sitting on one branch, the bird on another, not too close to the cat.
And the wolf walked round and round the tree, looking at them with hungry eyes.

No sooner had Peter gone, than a big grey wolf came out of the forest.
In a twinkling the cat climbed up into the tree.
The duck quacked, and in her excitement jumped out of the pond.
But no matter how hard the duck tried to run, she couldn't escape the wolf.
He was getting nearer, nearer, catching up with her.

It's just a one dollar secret
A lover's secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May-Day
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
And there's nothing inside
And there's nothing in mind no
And only you
Rocket on through the sky
Well it couldn't be done without dogs
Yeah it couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
When the days were the days boys
When blue ties were for the big guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hangin' on the enemy
And there's no one in love
And there's nowhere to scream no
And only you
Race on to wonder where
Well it couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
You can't make love with money
You can't make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
That's how I liked you best
Now you're ready for the real McCoy
Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murder on the heels of love
Just a ghost of a story
Just a one dollar secret
Baby these were the sounds
Baby these were the sounds
And only you
Whisper these things aren't true
Well it couldn't be done with dogs
Well it couldn't be once without us
87 and cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry cry cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry cry cry
'87 and cry
'87 and cry cry cry cry cry
'87 and cry cry cry cry cry

Hey
Hey
'87 and cry

Wow, this ain't the right thing to do
So, so let, so let's go
Young girls they know what they're after
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang reach for the sky
I keep a good friend on videotape
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight
Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang sun don't shine
Bang Bang you all angels
Bang Bang now you all ought to be in pictures
Oh girl
Oh girl my problems can't follow me
Phone calls I take my machine
I wander lonely to the sea
Lonely-Ha Ha Ha-what does it mean
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang and you are next in line
Bang Bang reach for the sky
Bang Bang sun don't shine
Rise buildings
Rise to the sky
Well young girls they know what they're after
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Bang bang
Then you close, then you should close, then you close down 
You big man
Bang Bang
Spot the brack
Just come in first
Bang Bang
If praise had wings
Bang Bang
And you next in line

Photograph king, watches you go
Now fashions may change, heaven knows, but you
Still leave a stain on me
Only to go colours may fade
The seasons may change, weather blows, but you still leave a mark on me
Wrong-negative fades-never the twain, reckless and tame
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
I beat it I beat I beat it
I feel it
Disco brat-follow the pack
Watching you peel, heaven knows, prison can't hold all this greedy intention
Only to go-I picture you now
Music may change-hi-di-ho keen to follow your nose
Wrong-love out of tune
Sweet is the night, bright light destroys me
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
I beat it I beat Can't beat it
I feel it
I like to beat on your drum
I like to beat on your drum
I like your face in the crowd
I like to beat on your drum
I beat it I beat Can't beat it
I feel it
Can't beat it
I feel it
Ho beat it
I beat it
Oh yeah
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to yell it out loud
I'd like to beat on your drum
Can't beat it can't beat it
I feel it I feel it
I'd like to beat on your drum

Baet it all out
Beat it all in the crowd
Beat it beat it beat it beat it

I'd like to blow your horne
I'd like to beat on your drum
Yeah yeah yeah
Ah

Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Day-in, ooh ooh
Day-out, ooh ooh ooh
She was born in a handbag, love left on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup, nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey, try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Day-in, ooh ooh
Day-out, ooh ooh ooh
First thing she learns is she's a citizen,
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Someone rings a bell and it's all over
She's going out her way
Stealing for that one good rush
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
She could use a little money
She's hangin' on his arms like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey, she's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night, big town, police, shake down
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
She's got a ticket to nowhere
She's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name
She's in the pocket of a home boy
Ooh she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow
Spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make them well aware
She's an angry gal
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Suddenly there's angels everywhere
Angels in a ton of sound
And they shootin' her down
Shootin' her with video-drugs-bullets and promises

Up until one century ago there lived,
In the Zi Duang province of eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web
In weeks creating a macabre
Shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers
Like floors in a building
At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew through this construction
It produced sounds of wailing, crying
Tiny wails, tiny cries
The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically
For their mother.
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies
Would survive someone on their own.
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.
Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now)
Take care, take care.
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.
But you, you've promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now.
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Gone, Gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you, savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn, come come come along before the animals awake
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Gone gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone

When I believed in nothing I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place I called her name
And though my days were slipping by
And nights so cruel I thought I'd die
She danced her little dance till it made me cry
She was shakin' like this honey doing that
When I needed soul revival I called your name
When I was falling to pieces I screamed in pain
Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real swept over me
You danced your little dance till it made me cry
You were shakin' like this honey doing that
Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down
When all your faith is failing Call my name
When you've got nothing coming Call my name
I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head till the bad stuff breaks
I'll dance my little dance till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that
Never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
Oh no

Do you see that thing
I'm sure it's love
Would you do one thing
New York's in love
The city grew wings in the back of night
The clouds are stuck like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from
There's nothing you can do to her
This city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher
New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks
New York's in love
Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo
My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat
No-one knows they've had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybody's waiting for the Go-Go Boys
You're turned to stone by the family
It's now the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here but a raging blaze
And I don't mean to wait too long
New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks
New York's in love
Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo
Pretty as a picture
New York's in love
New York's in love
New York's in flames

Eddie boy lit like paraffin spending two weeks in a crack house
Burns on his brain like Chernobyl
Dean was seen with a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone to pray for-till I met you
Life is like a broken arrow
Memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune
I can make you happy every day of your life
Making my love like a shining star
Takin' my love just a touch too far
Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice cause love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice, I've touched down with vermin,
Cowardice, lice,
And I say
Nobody cares what you do
Please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a
Bet you'll never find a better man.
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far
Peter met Frank formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky,
Sinn-Fein, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover this page with debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs
Threw it all away
Another life in the grave
Another life in the grave
Life is like a broken arrow
Memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune
Well I could make you happy every goddamn single day of your life
Making my love like a shining star
Like a shining star
Babe that's what you are
Like a shining star
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
Making my love like a shining star
Taking my love

I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose
I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot
He made him fly through a hole
Till he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst
Time will crawl till our mouths run dry
Time will crawl till our feet grow small
Time will crawl till our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose
I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear
Time will crawl, time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose
You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went on
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep
Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose
Time will crawl and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl and our feet grow small
Time will crawl and our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose
Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose
For the crazy child
We'll give every life
For the crackpot notion

There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
I'm not trying to lose control
But you're just pushin' pushin' pushin'for a fight
You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking looking looking for a break
Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away hey
What kind of love is he giving you
I'm-a-dizzy's what I'm trying to say
I said
Too Dizzy-You can't have a lover
I'm too Dizzy-It's me and no other
I'm a bad loser-I'm-a-shakin' in anger
I'm a too Dizzy-you can't have no lover
You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'm-a-ten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itchin'-twitchin'-itchin' for a break
There's too much talking for a night drive
And too much mist in front of my eyes
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking looking looking for a break
Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away
What kind of love is he giving you
I'm-a-dizzy's what I'm trying to say
I said
I'm too Dizzy-You can't have a lover
I'm too Dizzy-It's me and no other
And I'm a bad loser-I'm-a-shakin' in anger
I said too Dizzy-you can't have no lover
I said Too Dizzy
Don't come any harder
I said I'm Too Dizzy
Don't come any closer
I said I'm Too Dizzy
I said too Dizzy
Too Dizzy
Too Dizzy
Too Dizzy you can't have no lover
Too Dizzy
Too Dizzy
I'm Too Dizzy

(Ladies and Gentlemen)
(Tonight, yes, the Zeroes will be singing for you!)
Yeah Yeah (x4)
You've arrived in the land of a thousand different names
And the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames
Now tomorrow's back claiming redemption is on your heels
And a toothless past is asking you how it feels
And me my little red Corvette has driven by
My fair weather heart has fallen in
My rainy day girl is feeling down
And she tells me that the world is spinning round
I say the dream was all for you
You're nobody else
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you
Yeah Yeah
Yeah
Hi, can I walk you home again today
Gotta get forgive and forget hey-hey
Something good is happening I don't know what it is
Don't you know we're back on trial again today
And it's breaking wine for you
Hell it's only 'cause you're true
Someone outtimed my heart
Stopping and preaching and letting love in
You are my moon, you are my sun
Heaven knows what you are
Tonight the Zeroes are singing for you
Yes they were
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you
Doesn't matter what you try to do
Doesn't matter what you try to do
Doesn't matter where you try to go
Doesn't matter who we really are
Doesn't matter (repeat ad lib)
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter

There was a time, the laughing time
I took my heart to every party
They'd point my way
"How are you today? "
"Will you make us laugh? chase our blues away? "
Their funny man won't let them down
No, he'd dance and prance and be their clown
That time, the laughing time
When even a fool learns to love
The clown turned around
And saw her smile, oh how she loved me
She'd clap her hands and beg me stay
To make her laugh, to make her life gay
Who wants the love of all the world
When here was love in the eyes of just one girl
That day, that precious day
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love
That day, that hateful day
The joke turned stale, the game was over
Those spiteful words "oh, go away. who wants to play? "
"It's getting late now."
My world, my funny world
Had lost it's mask and shown a broken heart
A time, a sour time
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love

Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand,
Jack is in his coat, and Jane is her vest, and, me,
I'm in a rock'n'roll band. Huh!
Ridin' in a Stutz-Bearcat, Jim
Y'know, those were different times!
Oh, all the poet, they studied rules of verse,
And the ladies, they rolled their eyes.
Sweet Jane! Whoa! Sweet Jane, oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!
I'll tell you something,
Jack, he is a banker,
And Jane, she is a clerk.
Both of them save their monies, ha,
And when, when they come home from work!
Ooh! Sittin' down by the fire, oh!
The radio does play,
The classical music there, Jim.
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers".
All you protest kids.
You can hear Jack say, get ready, ah,
Sweet Jane! Come on baby now! Sweet Jane! Oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!
Some people, they like to go out dancing,
And other peoples, they have to work. Just watch me now!
And there's even some evil mothers,
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt.
Y'know that, women, never really faint,
And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!
And that, y'know, children are the only ones who blush!
And that, life is, just to die!
And, everyone who ever had a heart, oh,
That wouldn't turn around and break it.
And anyone who ever played a part, whoa,
And wouldn't turn around and hate it!
Sweet Jane! Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane.
Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane.
Heavenly wine and roses,
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles. ah,
Heavenly wine and roses,
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles. hey!
La-la-la-la-la-la,
La-la-la-la-la-la,
La-la-la-la-la-la,
La-la-la-la-la-la, oh
Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane!

I staggered through this criminal rain
I'm not in love, no phony pain
Creeping through this tidal wave
No warm embrace, just another strain
This symphony
This rage in me
I've got handful of songs to sing
To sting your soul, to fuck you over
This furious rage
I'm falling man
I'm choking man
I'm fading man
And broke and blind
I'm falling man
I'm choking man
I'm fading man
Just killing a little time
I love the sound of an empty room
The screams of night, the end of love
Two beating hearts, one laboured, scarred
One open wound, wasted and drawn
No sympathy
This furious rain
I lay in bed, the monster fed
The body bled, I turned and said:
"I get some of you all the time
"All of you some other time"
This rage in me
Get away from me
I'm falling man
I'm choking man
I'm fading man
I'm broke and blind
I'm falling man
I'm choking man
I'm fading man
Just killing a little time
This symphony
Get away from me

Look up here, I'm in heaven
I've got scars that can't be seen
I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now
Look up here, man, I'm in danger
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me
By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass
This way or no way
You know, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Now ain't that just like me
Oh, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Oh, I'll be free
Ain't that just like me

Here there's no music here
I'm lost in streams of sound
Here am I nowhere now?
No plan
Wherever I may go
Just where
Just there
I am
All of the things that are my life
My desires
My beliefs
My moods
Here is my place without a plan
Here
Second Avenue
Just out of view
Here
Is no traffic here?
No plan
All the things that are my life
My moods
My beliefs
My desires
Me alone
Nothing to regret
This is no place, but here I am
This is not quite yet

You took everything but nothing more Now the room is dark Feels like pain again You could feel my breath You opened my eyes For I could not see When I met you When I met you I could not speak You opened my mouth You opened my heart My spirit rose become the centre of my world The seeds of my life The streams of daybreak Now the wounds The peck of a blackened eye An eye for the crowd When I met you I could not speak When I met you met you My spirit rose My kind of truth could not exist When I met you Now it's all the same It's all the same The sun has gone It's all the same But when I met you When I met you When I met you When I met you 
When I met you [You were afraid] When I met you [She stole your heart] I was the walking dead [She tore you down] I was kicked in the head [She tore you down] It was such a time [When I met you] It was such a time [When I met you] I was crushed inside [When I met you] I was torn inside When I met you When I met you I was too insane Could not trust a thing I was off my head I was filled with truth It was not God's truth Before I met you

Well it's 1969 OK
All across the USA
It's another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
Last year I was 21
I didn't have a lot of fun
And now I'm gonna be 22
I say oh my and a boo-hoo
It's 1969 OK all across the USA
It's another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
Another year with nothing to do
It's 1969
1969
1969
1969
1969 baby
And it's 1969 baby
Baby
Baby

I found a picture of you, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
You had hijacked my world at night
To a place in the past we've been passed out of, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Now we're back in the fight
We're back on the train, yeah (ho-ah)
O-oh, back on the chain gang (ho-ah)
Circumstance beyond our control, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
The phone, TV and the news of the world
Got in the house like a pigeon from Hell, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies
And put us back on the train, yeah (ho-ah)
O-oh, back on the chain gang (ho-ah)
The powers that be
That force us to live like we do
Bring me to my knees
When I see what they've done to you
Well, I'll die as I stand here today
Knowing that deep in my heart
They'll fall to ruin one day
For making us part
I found a picture of you, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Those were the happiest days of my life
Like a break in the battle was your part, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
In the wretched life of a lonely heart
Now I'm back on the train, yeah (ho-ah)
O-oh, back on the chain gang (ho-ah)

So pull me out of this dream
Turn off the television
Put on a romantic vinyl
And come to bed again
Please be my next morning flower
But don't be there all the time
Leave me a couple of hours
Then bring me food and wine
Play with me, play with me
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel
I'll make this week disappear
Like I've erased several months
It's turning into a year now
And I'm still a manikin
You're so poetic when you're sad
So tiring when you cry
We could fly out and get married
I think I love you now
Play with me, play with me
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel
Play with me, play with
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel

When people call us revolutionary
They're just tryin' to see
All that we choose
When all we want is everybody free
The universe would be one brotherhood
It isn't wrong to be prepared to fight
Together to unite if we believe
In giving everything our heart and soul
Until we reach the goal we should achieve
It shouldn't matter if we're brown or white
Yellow or black as night to anyone
We're all born equal with the self same rights
Sharing the same daylight under the sun
If loving freedom makes me quality
Of opportunity is where revolutionary
Constantly, fervently, firmly
Revolutionary

Ooh, I've been dirt
And I don't care
Ooh, I've been dirt
And I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
'Cause I'm yearning inside
And I'm the fire of life
Yeah alright
Ooh, I've been hurt
And I don't care
Ooh, I've been hurt
And I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
'Cause I'm yearning inside
And do you feel it?
Said do you feel it
When you touch me?
I said do you feel it
When you touch me?
I'm fire
Well, it's a fire
Yeah alright
Oh it's just a burning inside
Oh it's just a yearning inside
Said do you feel it?
I said do you feel it
When you cut me?
Said do you feel it
When you cut me?
It's a fire, it's a fire
I'm a fire inside
Oh it's just a dreaming

Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel
He looks out a window without glass
The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
His father beats him 'cause he's too tired to beg
He's got 9 brothers and sisters
They're brought up on their knees
It's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
But that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard
He's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
He's going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, to the dirty boulevard
This room cost 2,000 dollars a month
You can believe it man it's true
Somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
No one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
They dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard
Give me your hungry, your tired your poor I'll piss on 'em
That's what the Statue of Bigotry says
Your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death
And get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard
Get to end up, on the dirty boulevard
Going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, on the dirty boulevard
Going out
Outside it's a bright night
There's an opera at Lincoln Center
Movie stars arrive by limousine
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
But the lights are out on the Mean Streets
A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
He's selling plastic roses for a buck
The traffic's backed up to 39th street
The TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck
And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
He's found a book on magic in a garbage can
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
"At the count of 3" he says, "I hope I can disappear"
And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly away
I want to fly
Fly, fly away
I want to fly
Fly-fly away (Fly a-)
Fly-fly-fly (-way, ooh...)
Fly-fly away (I want to fly-fly away)
Fly away (I want to fly, wow-woh, no, fly away)

I'm home, lost my job, and incurably ill
You think this is easy, realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh no
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me, oh
One more, weekend, of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no (kiss-kiss)
Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers
I've got believers
I've got believers
I've got believers in me
I've got believers
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I am a D.J.

Gimme danger, little stranger
And I'll feel you bleed
Gimme danger, little stranger
And I'll heal your disease
There's nothing in my dreams
But some ugly memories
Kiss me like the ocean breeze
Well if you will be my lover
I will shiver and sing
But if you won't be my master
I will do anything
There's nothing left alive
But some dark glassy eyes
Raise my fears one more time
Come on little danger, die a little stranger
Swear you're gonna feel my hell
Come on little stranger, die a little later
Swear you're gonna feel my hell
Swear you're gonna feel my hell
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Every day
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
I gotta feel it
I gotta feel it
I gotta feel it
You gotta feel it, I gotta feel it
I wanna feel it...

(Just for one day)

People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans jumped up on the stage
And Lady Stardust sang her songs of darkness and dismay
And he was alright, the band was all together
And he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice, really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long
The femme fatales emerged from shadows to watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs to make their point of view
And I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
And Lady Stardust sang his songs of darkness and dismay
And he was alright, the band was all together
And he was alright, his song went on forever
And he was awful nice, really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long
Oh how I lied when they asked if I knew his name
For he was alright, the band was all together
And he was alright, his song went on forever
And he was awful nice, really quite paradise
And he sang all night long

Like an inventor
He is a symbol of a new age
He glides above the realms
Of you and me
He flows through your life
And makes you feel quite small
You may sit up in your chair
He doesn't care at all
He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
His gowns come from paris
Occasionally from rome
He can go anywhere
Say back to his home
He flows through your life
And makes you feel quite small
Flashing to the white collars
Ha, he doesn't care at all
He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
Please...
He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
Please...

In the morning, sounds the alarm
Is it a warning of all the things to come?
On my pillow, there is blood
I try to speak but only think a word
Reflecting windows, by the sun
My mouth is gone.
Well damn the songs I'd sung if I had know, my mouth is gone
When a man without a mouth, lets his dog out.
He just runs away.
It's been so long since he has heard his name.
When a man without a mouth wants to speak, he's got things to say
In my car, I hum the tune along, to a radio song.
When I go to work, it's just like this.
Except there's no smile for the receptionist.
Except I can't smoke my cigarette.
When the boss says I'm late I can't say back its metamorphosis
When a man without a mouth, lets his dog out.
He just runs away.
It's been so long since he has heard his name
When a man without a mouth wants to speak
He's got things to say
When a man without a mouth, lets his dog out.
He just runs away.
It's been so long since he has heard his name

Way down here you need a reason to move
Feel a fool running your stateside games
Lose your load, leave your mind behind Baby Jane
Oh, Mexico
It sounds so simple I just got to go
The sun's so hot I forgot to go home
Guess I'll have to go now
Americano got the sleepy eye
But his body's still shaking like a live wire
Sleepy Se√±orita with the eyes on fire
Oh, Mexico
It sounds so sweet with the sun sinking low
The moon's so bright like to light up the night
Make everything all right
Baby's hungry and the money's all gone
The folks back home don't want to talk on the phone
She gets a long letter, sends back a postcard
Times are hard
Oh, down in Mexico
I never really been so I don't really know
Oh, Mexico
I guess I'll have to go
Oh, Mexico
I never really been but I'd sure like to go
Oh, Mexico
I guess I'll have to go now
Talking 'bout in Mexico
In a honky tonk down in Mexico
Oh, Mexico
Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico
Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico
Mexico, Mexico

No fun my babe
No fun
No fun my babe
No fun
No fun to hang around
Feelin' that same old way
No fun to hang around
Freaked out for another day
No fun my babe
No fun
No fun my babe
No fun
No fun to be alone
Walking by myself
No fun to be alone
In love with somebody else
Well maybe go out, maybe stay home

No fun to be alone

Hang on
Don't you lemme go
It's no fun to alone
To be alone

No sooner had Peter gone
Than a big gray wolf came out of the forest
In a twinkling
The cat climbed up into the tree
The duck quacked and in her excitement
Jumped out of the pond
But no matter how hard the duck tried to run
She couldn't escape the wolf
He was getting nearer, nearer
Catching up with her

Ai-yah
Oh yeah
I'm up on the eleventh floor and I'm watching the cruisers below
Oh well her heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all-time low
He's down on the street and he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
'Cause she's hoping to score, so I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart - walk out of her mind
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
And her frock coat and bibbity-bobbity hat
Oh God I could do better than that
She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking night walking games
Oh and she's known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames
And if she says she can do it then she can do it
She don't make false claims
Oh she's a queen and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on, and she'll lay him right down
Yes she's leading him on, and she'll lay him right down
But it could've been me, yes it could've been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say?
No no no
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
And her frock coat and bibbity-bobbity hat
Oh God I could do better than that
So I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall
The cot feels so cold, it don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while, and look at my hotel wall
And he's down on the street so I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab, 'cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth, but it's no taste at all
It could've been me, oh yes it could've been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say?
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
And her frock coat and bibbity-bobbity hat
Oh God I could do better than that
You betcha
Oh yeah

Dance to the beat

Fall deep in love

Can you feel it?

Raw power

She had an horror of rooms she was tired you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again
She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies
She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

My name is Mr. Touchshriek
Of Touchshriek, mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores
And empty females
I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide Internet
He's a broken man, I'm also a broken man
It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Lookin' through windows for demons
Watchin' the young advance in all electric
Some of the houses 'round here still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing
If I had another broken name, oh, I dream of something like that

Test, testing, testing
This, hmm, Grace is my name and, and I was, hm
It was that phot, a fading photograph of
A patch, a patchwork quilt
And they've put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs
So I'm thinking very, too, bit too fast like a brain hatch
And, ah, they won't let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop, popular musics and aftershocks
I've been watching a television of, um, in the homelands
That's the new homelands and, um, and that's all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horrid

When she broke it off with Leon
She said, "The ring is enough
I don't wanna see his face again"
Ramona was so cold

Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, engines on
Check ignition and may God's love be with you
Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five,
Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
For here
Am I floating round my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows"
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do."

Open hands catch the light you're after
Breathe again fill the moon with laughter
Kill the man in his house of infidels

Just then grandfather came out. He was angry because Peter had gone in the meadow. "It is the dangerous place. If a wolf should come out of the forest, then what would you do?"
But Peter paid no attention to his grandfather's words. Boys like Peter aren't afraid of wolves.
But grandfather took Peter by the hand, locked the gate and led him home.

This is the story of Peter and the wolf.
Each character in the tale is going to be represented by a different instrument of the orchestra. For instance, the bird will be played by the flute. (Like this.) Here's the duck, played by the oboe.
The cat by the clarinet.
The bassoon will represent grandfather.
The wolf by the French horns.
And Peter by the strings.
The blast of the hunters' shotguns played by the kettle drums.
Are you sitting comfortably? Then I shall begin.

Meanwhile, Peter made a lasso and carefully letting it down and down and down, caught the wolf by the tail and pulled with all his might.
Feeling himself caught, the wolf began to jump wildly trying to get loose.
But Peter tied the other end of rope to the tree, and the wolf's jumping only made the rope round his tail tighter.

In the meantime, Peter, without the slightest fear, stood behind the gate watching all that was going on.
He ran home, got a strong rope, and climbed up the high stone wall.
One of the branches of the tree around which the wolf was walking stretched out over the wall.
Grabbing hold of the branch, Peter lightly climbed over on to the tree.

Peter said to the bird: "Fly down and circle over the wolf's head. Only take care that he doesn't catch you."
The bird almost touched the wolf's head with his wings while the wolf snapped angrily at him, this side and that.
How that bird teased the wolf! And how the wolf wanted to catch him! But the bird was clever, and the wolf simply couldn't do anything about it.

On a branch of a big tree sat a little bird, Peter's friend. "All is quiet, All is quiet" chirped the bird gaily. Yes all is quiet.

Just then a duck came waddling round. She was glad that Peter hadn't closed the gate and decided to take a nice swim in the deep pond in the meadow.
Seeing the duck, the little bird flew down upon on the grass, settled next to her and shrugged his shoulders.
"What kind of bird are you if you can't fly?" said he. To this the duck replied "What kind of bird are you if you can't swim?" and dived into the pond.
They argued and argued, the duck swimming in the pond and the little bird hopping along the shore.
Suddenly, something caught Peter's attention. It was a cat crawling through the grass.
The cat thought: "The bird is busy arguing, I'll just grab him". Stealthily she crept towards him on his velvet paws.
"Look out!" shouted Peter and the bird immediately flew up into the tree, while the duck quacked at the cat, from the middle of the pond. The cat walked around the tree and thought, "Is it worth climbing up so high? By the time I get there the bird will have flown away."

Just then the hunters came out of the woods, following the wolf's trail and shooting as they went.

But Peter, sitting in the tree, said: "Don't shoot! Birdie and I have already caught the wolf. Now help us take him to the zoo."
Now just imagine, just imagine the triumphant procession. Peter at the head. After him the hunters leading the wolf. And winding up the whole procession grandfather and the cat.
Grandfather shook his head discontentedly. "Well, if Peter hadn't caught the wolf? What's then?"
Above them flew Birdie chirping merrily. "My, what brave fellows we are, Peter and I! Look what we have caught!"
And if one would listen very carefully, he would hear the duck quacking inside the wolf, because the wolf, in his hurry, had swallowed her alive.

Early one morning, Peter opened the gate and went out into the big green meadow.

And now, this is how things stood: the cat was sitting on one branch, the bird on another, not too close to the cat.
And the wolf walked round and round the tree, looking at them with hungry eyes.

No sooner had Peter gone, than a big grey wolf came out of the forest.
In a twinkling the cat climbed up into the tree.
The duck quacked, and in her excitement jumped out of the pond.
But no matter how hard the duck tried to run, she couldn't escape the wolf.
He was getting nearer, nearer, catching up with her.

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light
In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon
And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
"Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side"
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly
In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamps
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
Well he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
And he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam

I wander round, feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think this rock is grand
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
I met this chick, the other day
And then to me, she said she'll stay
I get this pad, just like a cave
And then we'll have, our living made
And then I'll lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Oh
Huh huh huh huh I need a lover 'cause someone new
And then to her I will be true
I'll buy her furs and pretty things
I'll even buy a wedding ring
But until then I'll settle down
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Until then I'll settle down

Well I stood stone like at midnight
Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair 'til it was just right
And commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
Came out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
But when they said sit down, I stood up
Ooh-ooh, growin' up
The flag of piracy flew from my mast 
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate 
She couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed the B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues 
With my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school 
Never once gave thought to landing, no
And I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd 
When they said come down, I threw up
Ohh-oh, growin' up
I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere 
You know it's really hard to hold your breath
And I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared 
I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well my feet finally took root in the earth 
But I got a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe 
In the engine of an old parked car
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd 
But when they said move down, I moved up
Oh-oh-oh, don't you know that I'm growin' up
I said, oh-oh-oh, I can't help it that I'm growin' up

Oh... here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Oh, yeah (here comes the night)
I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl
With another guy
His arms around her like it used to be with me
Oh it makes me want to die
Yeah, here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, (here comes the night) here comes the night
Yeah... (here comes the night)
There they go, funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me
Why can't I accept the fact she's chosen him
And simply let them be?
Here it comes
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Yeah... (here comes the night)
Oh she's with him they're turning down the lights
Now he's holding her the way I used to do
I can see her closing her eyes and telling him lies
Exactly like she told me too
Oh, here it comes
Here comes the night
Oh, he here comes the night
Yeah... (here comes the night)
Here, here it comes the
Here, here it comes the
Here comes the night yaeh
Lonely, lonely night
Lonely, lonely night
Oh ooh ho here comes the night
Here comes the night yeah

New feeling inside
It's a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down my soul, baby
I can't explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they're true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means, but
Can't explain
I think it's love
Say it to you
When I feel blue
I can't explain, no, I can't explain
You know I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind
Well I'm a worried guy
But I can't explain

Early in the morning by the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby I wish you would
This crying and grieving won't do me no good
Hugging and a-kissing, late at night
You know pretty baby it feels just right
Come back baby what you're trying to do?
Turning on me and some other men too
Come back baby give me one more chance
You know I still love you gonna give you romance
Yeah, romance all night long
In my arms, oh yeah
Early in the morning by the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby I wish you would
This crying and grieving won't do me no good
Hey pretty baby I love you so
You know pretty baby it hurts me to see you go
Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah

Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
All the night and all the day
Hide and seek's the game you play
Treat me as sure as sin
Oh Rosalyn, yeah Rosalyn
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
When I'm holding you so tight
It's so hard to say goodnight

Do you really love me, do you love me true
Do you really love me Rosalyn?
Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn
Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn
Rosalyn
Yeah Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, ooh-yeah, ah

Emily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
Emily
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise
Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same
(Come tomorrow), will I be older
(Come tomorrow), maybe a soldier
(Come tomorrow), may I be bolder than today
Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been
Boy into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these land
Don't make them desert sands
(Come tomorrow), will I be older
(Come tomorrow), maybe a soldier
(Come tomorrow), may I be bolder than today
Soon I hope that I will find
A seed within my mind
That won't disgrace my kind

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
You acted funny trying to spend my money
You're out there playing your high class games of sorrow
Sorrow
You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ah, ah, ah
I tried to find her 'cause I can't resist her
(I tried to find her 'cause I can't resist her)
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair

In my life I've never stopped to worry about a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to see
Wondering if I'd done wrong (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu)
Will this depression last for long
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu)
Please let me have happy days
Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu)
And Mummy didn't need no boys
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down (uuuh uh uh uuuh hu)
Get your feet back on the ground
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

Als ob nichts geschieht (Nichts geschieht)
Und die Scham fiel auf ihre Seite
Oh, wir k√∂nnen sie schlagen
F√ºr alle Zeiten

Listen Lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be lie-high-high-high-high-high, my! Oh my!
Slowly, we get too good and too holy
Helping one another, just a righteous brother

I don't want to be angel, just a little bit evil

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be

Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
Let go of me

Ooh
He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions, they followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Putting on some clothes, I made my way to school
I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights
Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table, a gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit, he'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust," I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Ow

La mia mente ha preso il volo
Un pensiero uno solo
Io cammino mentre dorme la citt√†
I suoi occhi nella notte
Fanali bianchi nella notte
Una voce che mi parla chi sar√†?
Dimmi ragazzo solo dove vai,
perch√© tanto dolore?
Hai perduto senza dubbio un grande amore
Ma di amori √® tutta piena la citt√†,
No ragazza sola, no no no
Stavolta sei in errore
Non ho perso solamente un grande amore
Ieri sera ho perso tutto con lei.
Ma lei
I colori della vita
Dei cieli blu
Una come lei non la trover√≤ mai pi√π
Ora ragazzo solo dove andrai
La notte √® un grande mare
Se ti serve la mia mano per nuotare
Grazie ma stasera io vorrei morire
perch√© sai negli occhi miei
C'√® un angelo, un angelo
Che ormai non vola pi√π che ormai non vola pi√π
Che ormai non vola pi√π
C'√® lei
I colori della vita
Dei cieli blu
Una come lei non la trover√≤
Mai pi√π

Well, the joint was rocking
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down
Well it sounded so sweet
I had to take me a chance
I rose out of my seat
And had to dance
I started moving my feet
And clapping my hands
Yeah, we kept on rocking
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down
About twelve o'clock
When the place was packed
The front doors were locked
I said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But kept on rocking
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down
Yeah
About twelve o'clock
Around lock up time
Well, the doors were locked
Said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But it kept on rocking
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down
Yeah, it kept on rocking
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down

You got crazy legs, you got amazin' head
You got rings on your fingers and your hair's hot red
You got the width of my tongue name on the sun
I clutch you close to my breast
'Cause you're the only one, who uses school to pleasure
You make me act real gone, you make me troll along
I had to ravish your capsule, suck you dry
Feel the teeth in your bones, heal ya head with my own
Why if I don't have you whole, is that your final love?
Here all together
Velvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain
Snake it, take it, panther princess you must stay
Velvet goldmine, naked on your chain
I'll be your king volcano right for you again and again
My velvet goldmine
You're my taste, my trip, I'll be your master zip
I'll chop your hair off for kicks, you'll make me jump to my feet
So you'll give me your hand, give me your sound
Let my sea wash your face, I'm falling, I can't stand
Ooh! Clutch your makeup!
Velvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain
Snake it, take it, panther princess you must stay
Velvet goldmine, naked on your chain
I'll be your king volcano right for you again and again
My velvet goldmine
Oh
Shoot you down, bang bang
Velvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain
Snake it, take it, panther princess you must stay
Velvet goldmine, naked on your chain
I'll be your king volcano right for you again and again
My velvet goldmine

They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All night)
But she wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture window (Doo doo doo doo)
She finds the slinky vagabond (Doo doo doo doo)
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak and his type, all for nothing (Doo doo doo doo)
Misses a step and cuts his hand, but (Doo doo doo doo)
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song, she cries
"Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yeah, ah-yeah
(She wants the young American)
All right
(All right)
Well, she wants the young American
All the way from Washington
Her breadwinner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?", well
(All night)
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yes, he does, ah
(He wants the young American)
Mmm mmm mmm
(All right) Well, all right
Well, he wants the young American
Do you remember your President Nixon? (Doo doo doo doo)
Do you remember the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American? (Doo doo doo doo)
Just you and your idol sing falsetto 'bout (Doo doo doo doo)
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor (Doo doo doo doo)
In case, just in case of depression? (Doo doo doo doo)
Sit on your hands on the bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro Sheeners
Ain't that close to love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, ain't that poster love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, it ain't that Barbie Doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and
(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American, young American)
Young American, ah
(You want the young American)
All right, ah
(All right)
You want the young American
You ain't a pimp, and you ain't a hustler
(Young American, young American)
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
(You want the young American)
(All night)
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh, boy)
I got a suite and-ah you got defeat
(All night)
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And ain't there a child I can hold without judging-ah?
(Young American, young American)
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
(All right)
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?
All night
I want the young American
(Young American, young American)
The young American
(I want the young American)
(All right)
All night, I want the young American, young American
(Young American, young American)
I want what you want, I want what you want
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want what I, I want you, you want I, I want, you want
(Young American, young American)
I want what you want, but you want what I want, you
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want I, I want you
And all I want is a young American-ah
(Young American, young American)
A young American, a young American
(I want the young American)
(All night)

You promised me the ending would be clear
You'd let me know when the time was now
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Stab me in the dark, let me disappear
Memories that flutter like bats out of Hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasn't worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on
Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible
Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down a river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the street with the good time girl
Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible
We could dance, dance, dance through the fire
Dance, dance, dance through the fire
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the Disco King
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive
Feed me no lies
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the head of the Disco King
Spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the 70's
Smelling of love through the moist wind
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Close me in the dark, let me disappear
Soon there'll be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release
Dance, dance, dance through the fire
Dance, dance, dance through the fire
Tell me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the Disco King
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
Dead or alive
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King

Hold me tight
Keep me cool
Going mad
Don't know what to do
Do I need a friend?
Well I need one now
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All I've done
I've done for me
All you gave
You gave for free
I gave nothing in return
And there's little left of me
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
With redeyed pain I'm knocking on your door again
My crazy brain in tangles pleading for your gentle voice
Those storms keep pounding through my faded heart
I'll play your sooth my sorry soul
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life

Hope little girl
Come blow me away
I don't care much
I'll win anyway
Just a dog
I'm God damn rich
An exploding man
When I talk in the night
There's oil on my hands
What a dog
Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon
Devil in a market place
Devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dog
There's always a moron
Someone to hate
A corporate tie
A wig and a date
Just a dog
These blackest of years
That have no sound
No shape, no depth
No underground
What a dog
Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon
A devil in a market place
A devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dog

Still the leaves are spinning 'round
Take my hand as we go down, and down, and down
Looking for water 
Well, our light's gone in a New York minute
Don't know about you, but my heart's not in it
(Looking, looking, looking)
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
(Looking, looking, looking)
I can't breathe the air, can't raise a fact
'Cause all we've got left is a beat in the night, and I'm
(Looking for water)
Looking for water
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
Take my hand as we go down, and down
Leave it all behind, nothing could be found
(I'm, looking for water)
I'm looking for water
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
(I, looking for water)
Looking everywhere
(Looking for water)
Looking here and there
(I'm looking for water)
I'm looking for water
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
I can't live in this cage, I can't eat this candy
The edge of the earth to the spin in my head
The look in your eyes and never means never
The dawn's early light, baby, dark is forever
(Looking, looking)
(Looking, looking)
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
I
(Looking for water)
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
I
(Looking for water)

(Looking for watter)
Looking, looking)

Better take care
I think I better go, better get a room
Better take care of me
Again and again
I think about this and I think about personal history
Better take care
I breath so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
Looks me in the eye, says he's got his mind on a countdown (3, 2, 1)
Forever
I'm screaming that I'm gonna be living on till the end of time
Forever
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
My head hangs low 'cause it's all over now
And there's never gonna be enough money
And there's never gonna be enough drugs
And I'm never ever gonna get old
There's never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
And I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
And I'm never ever gonna get low
And I'm never ever gonna get old
Better take care
The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you
Again and again
And I'm awake in an age of light and living it because of you
Better take care
I'm looking to the future, solid as a rock
Because of you
Again and again
Wanna be here, then I wanna be there
Living just like you, living just like me
Forever
Putting on my gloves
And I bury my bones in the marshland
Forever
Think about my soul
But I don't need a thing
Just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air
And I'm running down the street of life
And I'm never gonna let you die
And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get...
I'm never ever gonna get...
And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get...
And I'm never ever gonna get...
I'm never ever gonna get old

See the great white scar
Over Battery park
Then a flare glides over
But I won't look at that scar
Oh, my nuclear baby
Oh, my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
Let's face the music and dance
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) A new killer star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) The stars in your eyes
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in color
First a horseback bomber
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on dateline
Let's face the music and dance
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) A new killer star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) The stars in your eyes
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way)

- Lyrics and music by David Bowie 
Tragic youth was looking young and sexy
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief
The tragic youth was going down on me
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
I built a wall of sound to separate us
And hid among the junk of wretched highs
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Ha ha ha ha
Whoo hoo
Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight
Da da da da da da da da da
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da da da da da da da da da
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
Woo hoo
I still don't remember how this happened
I still don't get the wherefores and the whys
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
Hey boy welcome to reality
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
I've been right and I've been wrong
Now I'm back where I started from
Never looked over reality's shoulder
Ha ha ha ha
Huh ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Huh ha ha
Wooh
Woo hoo
Wooh

- Lyrics and music by David Bowie
She waited by the moon
She was sick with fear and cold
She felt too old for all of this
Of course he'll never show
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
Melted home, through the snow
North-bound on river-side
She slipped beneath the sheets
Her husband's quiet devoted wife
But strange, and sad, and nervous
By the dawn's early light
And love lies like a dead clown
On a shabby yellow lawn
Up on Riverside
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
She'll keep her mind on Jessica
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio high
Find a station playing sad, sad, soul
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
She'll drive the big car
Tuck herself to sleep
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now
(I'll bring you there)
Way back when millennium
Meant racing to the light
He promised her the dream life
He took her back to street life
Away from wild and water
With his cormorants and leaves
Up on Riverside
Uh, she'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
Bursting her bubbles of love and grand
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio way up high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
(I'll bring you there)
She'll keep her mind on Jessica
Just a little bit faster now
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)

Streets turn from walls
Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy 
Steam on the floor
Shots by the mirror's frame
Clouds green and old
No Sign No nothing Now
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
All the pages that have turned
All the errors left unlearned, oh
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
In the world
Not me
Not me

Way back in time
Someone said try some
I tried some
Now buy some
I bought some
Oh, ho
 
After a while
When I had tried them
Denied them
I opened my eyes 
And I saw you
Not a thing did I have
Not a thing did I see
Till I called on your love
And your love came to me
Woh, ho, ho 
Oh, ho
Woh, ho, ho
Oh, ho
Oh, ho, ho
Oh, ho
Through my life
I've seen gray sky
Met big fry
Seen them die 
To get high
Oh, ho, ho
And when it seemed that 
I would only 
Be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you
Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
Till I called on your love
And your love sure did grow
Woh, ho, ho 
Oh, ho
Woh, ho, ho
Oh, ho
Oh, ho, ho, oh
Won't you try some?
Baby, won't you buy some? 
Won't you try some?
Baby, won't you buy some? 
Woh, woh
Woh, ho, oh
Woh, woh
Woh, ho, oh
Woh, woh, woh, oh
Woh, woh, 
Woh, ho, oh

Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, makes me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise
Every day I look at the world from my window
Chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine
Terry meets Julie at Waterloo Station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander
I stay at home at night
But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise
Every day I look at the world from my window
Chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine
Millions of people swarming like flies 'round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise
Waterloo sunset's fine (Waterloo sunset's fine)
Waterloo sunset's fine (Waterloo sunset's fine)
Waterloo sunset's fine (Waterloo sunset's fine)
Waterloo sunset's fine

Oh, show me the way to the next whiskey bar
Oh, don't ask why, no don't ask why
For we must find the next whiskey bar
Oh, if we don't find the next whiskey bar

Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from ground control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the action man:
"I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following"
The shrieking of nothing is killing just
Pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but this planet is glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing...
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again, I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said, "To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom"
My mother said...

Psychodelicate girl - come out to play
Little metal faced-boy - don't stay away
They're so war-torn and resigned she can't talk any
More
What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?
It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know
Because you're young - you'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young - what could be nicer for you and it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars
He punishes hard - was loving her such a crime
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive
It's love back to front and no sides - like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know
Because you're young - you'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young - what could be nicer for you and it I'll make me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars
A million
A million scars
A million
A million dreams
A million
A million
A million
A million
A million

There's a brand new dance but I don't know it's name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland, full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here
Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, turn to the right
Ooh, fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me
No, beep-beep
There's a brand new talk but it's not very clear (ooh, bop)
That people from good homes are talking this year (ooh, bop, fashion)
It's loud and it's tasteless, I've not heard it before (ooh, bop)
Shout it while you're dancing on the dance floor (ooh, bop, fashion)
Fashion, turn to the left

We are the goon squad and we're coming to town

Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie - heaven or hearth
Just big heads and drums - full speed and pagan
And it's no game
I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation
So where's the moral
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading
And it's no game
Documentaries on refugees, couples 'gainst the target
Throw a rock against the road, and it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers
And it's no game
Children round the world, put camel shit on the walls
They're making carpets on treadmills, or garbage sorting
And it's no game

Shirueto ya kage ga kakumei o miteiru
Mo tengoku no giu no kaidan wa nai
Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
It's no game
Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare
Nani ga okkote iru ka wakara nai
Doko ni kyokun wa aruka
Hitobito wa yabi oorareteiru
Konna dokusaishani igashima rareru nowa kanashi
I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation
And it's no game
Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
They throw the rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday
And it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain
And it makes all the papers
Nammino kiroku eiga
Hioteki o se ni shita koibi to tach
Michi ni ishi o nage reba
Konago na mi kudake
Kino ni hutao sureba
Kyohu wa masu
Ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba
Shinbun wa kaki tateru
So where's the moral when people have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists - it's so degrading
And it's no game
Shut up!
Shut up!

Well I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries "It's all in vain"
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day
Well I'll be breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay
Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just the slave of a burning ray
Oh give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night
Well I'll be breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay
Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die
I won't be breaking no rocks
I said "I won't be breaking no rocks"
(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
(I won't be breaking no rocks) 
When the kingdom comes (repeat ad inf)

Ooh
He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions, they followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Putting on some clothes, I made my way to school
I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights
Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table, a gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit, he'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust," I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Ow

She had an horror of rooms she was tired you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again
She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies
She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise
And I wouldn't go to war
And I mixed with other colours
But the nurse doesn't care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day
But I remember Sam 'cause he was like me
Screaming like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Well they came down hard on the f*****s
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains, and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning to be a part of soc-society
Soc socie s
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
No athletic program, no discipline, no book
He just sat in the backseat swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

"Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
"Ground Control to Major Tom (10, 9, 8, 7, 6)
Commencing countdown, engines on (5, 4, 3, 2)
Check ignition and may God's love be with you (1, lift off)
"This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare"
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
"For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
"Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much" - "She knows.
"Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you..."
"Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do"

Well, how come you only want tomorrow
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above, sun on your arms strength in your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire - I guess the season is on
So you trade by shadow boxing, search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul are you
One of the new wave boys
Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, oh-ooh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending it's a whizz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
"Well, David, what shall, shall I do?
They wait for me in the hallway"
I'll say "Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways"
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
And I feel like a group of one, no-no
They can't do this to me
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife
Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
And the word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
And you're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind
You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife
And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you couldn't pass the test
There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low
'I miss you he had to go'
Well each to his own, he was
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-oh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-oh
Another piece of teenage wild...

Wild - Life
Wild - Life

The vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling - witnesses falling
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be all right
While we sleep they go to work
We're legally crippled it's the death of love
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
More idols than realities
I'm OK, you're so-so
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, if one can grasp it
Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be all right ooh-ooh

When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind in life
Shadows stalking, ever grasping sinking for a need
It was love it was the fix of wanting me
Now I'm gone, you're tossing and you turning in your sleep
That's the name of the game, of the game, of the game
Cry, Mr Pathetic
I'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
You the halo_system
Take a look at how lucky we are
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind
Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
Some days are heaven, I will not deny
Probing the daylight cascading the skyline
Tripping and diving and losing it all
Back came the night time living for more
Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now that I'm gone
I was the devil monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind

I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I've got moon, I've got sun
Lightning, lightning, lightning
I've got me, I've got you
Frightening, frightening, frightening
I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house
I'll give you back my right to be free
I'll give you back my farm and I'll give you back my house

Hmm ah (giggle)
Gather round all you people
Watch me while you can
I've been trawling too long
I've been losing out strong
For the strength of another man
I've been hasty, wasty
Sitting on the backstep
Waiting for the phone to ring]
This semi-acoustic love affair
Is driving me to the brink
I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
God help all you ladies
May the devil take all you men
You're far too busy having babies
To help yourselves to a friend
You're lazy, crazy
Hung upon the insane
Standing with your back to the wall]
My pretty has a picture, oh-so nice
Hoping that you might call
I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
You don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Hey
Hey looking
I'm just looking for a friend
I'm just looking for a friend
Oh, you don't have to be a big wheel
You don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Looking 
Just a-cruising
Vulgar
Just looking (giggle)
Don't have to be a big wheel
Don't have to be the end
I'm just looking for
Looking for a friend
Oh yeah (etc.)

There's a man back a-ways
Who believes at where he is
And there's a girl
Almudena Jane
Up ahead who says she knows
And the street overflows
With the folk who understand
But for the brigader who can't be seen
He's the Shadow Man
And the Shadow Man is close at hand
Take a turn and see his smile
Made of nothing but loneliness
Just take a walk and be a friend
To the Shadow Man
You can call him John, you can call him Sam
You should call and see who answers
For he promises to come running, guided by the truth
But the Shadow Man is really you
Look in his eyes and see your reflection
Look to the stars and see his eyes
He'll show you tomorrow, he'll show you the sorrows
Of what you did today
You can call him foe, you can call him friend
You should call and see who answers
For he knows your eyes are drawn to the road ahead
And the Shadow Man is waiting round the bend
Oh, the Shadow Man
Ohooooo ooh
Shadow man, shadow man
It's really you, it's really you, it's really you
He's the shadow man
Oh yeah
Shadow man

I don't know why but I'm tired of my mind
Pain is over me, overloading
I don't know why but you're trying to be kind
Take off your silver smile, throw your head back
And cry
I don't believe but I'm trying to decide
Which game is best for me, which can I bare
You don't perseve so I'm leading you away
Home were you've never been, non-returning
So cry
Throw a rock upon the road and it breaks into pieces
Shake brach upon the snow and the sun is defeated
Pull the curtains on yesterday and it seems so much later
Put a bullet in my brain and I'll make all the papers
I don't know why but I'm tired of my life
The clouds are in my eyes, overtaking

Everybody young and old
Learns how to rock 'n' roll
Listen to something new
Everybody sure can do

Ich glaub' das zu tr√§umen (Zu tr√§umen)
Die Mauer
Im R√ºcken war kalt (So kalt)
Sch√ºsse rei√üen die Luft (Rei√üen die Luft)
Doch wir k√ºssen
Als ob nichts geschieht (Nichts geschieht)
Und die Scham fiel auf ihre Seite
Oh, wir k√∂nnen sie schlagen
F√ºr alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Just for one day

US bombs crusin' overhead
There goes my love rocket red
Shoot it up
Blaster bomb bomb bomb ahead
Multi millions still unfed
A mondo teeno givin' head
Shoot it up
Hold me shake me, I'm all shook up
Psycho maniac, interbred
Shoot it up
Shoot it up hu
Shoot it up hu
Teenage crime now fashion's dead
There goes my love rocket red
Shoot it up
Shoot it up
Shoot it up
Shoot it up

Frozen to the glass again
Out of our skins again
Cold I am, tonight I am
Tomorrow's really on my mind
Sure to think of, from now on
The things will move more slowly
But thin is thin and chances slim
And sometimes we all have those dreams
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
In this skyline
The past it almost shimmers now
All we needed, all we wished for
But here I am and safe am I
Trusting in the lament sky
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
In this skyline
Skyline
Skyline
Skyline
Are things getting better now?
Are things getting worse?
But I'm standing in the sunshine
And it lifts my heart and feeds my mind
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
In this skyline

How to make amends for the things they said
The girls avoid the stormy sky
But I and my cloudy face
Will be gone, high-tailing out of here
Is the lights a-blazing in their lonely town?
I love the little cars at dawn
But I and my heathen heart
Will be lain upon some foreign shore
Here's the saddest Joe on the corner of the town
"Listen to the words!" he cries
I love him in his craziness, his tatters and his courage
He'll thumb his nose at the straight and true
When the boys come marching home
They'll fly his rags from the highest tree
When the boys come marching home
(When the boys come marching home)
(Home, marching home)
Aching for some innocence and peace of mind
While the moon pulls up its net of souls
The sun presses down on my brave new world
But, in truth, I don't feel brave at all
Leave it all behind me to the townies and the wags
The kids who never learned to smile
While I and the cobbled nag I ride
Stumble down another weary mile
Here's to those who cluster,
Walking through the wars
The girls who never close till dawn
They rag upon the feeble
And they swan around the stronger
But their eyes are fixed on the edge of town
When the boys come marching home
They'll slide from view - tiny, two by two
When the boys come marching home
(Home, marching home)
(Home, marching home)
When the boys come marching home
(When the boys come marching home)
Boys come marching home
(Home, marching home)
(Home, when the boys come marching home)
(Home, marching home)
(Home)
(When the boys come marching home)

Well it's 1969 OK
All across the USA
It's another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
Last year I was 21
I didn't have a lot of fun
And now I'm gonna be 22
I say oh my and a boo-hoo
It's 1969 OK all across the USA
It's another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
Another year with nothing to do
It's 1969
1969
1969
1969
1969 baby
And it's 1969 baby

I found a picture of you, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
You had hijacked my world at night
To a place in the past we've been passed out of, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Now we're back in the fight
We're back on the train, yeah (ho-ah)
O-oh, back on the chain gang (ho-ah)
Circumstance beyond our control, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
The phone, TV and the news of the world
Got in the house like a pigeon from Hell, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies
And put us back on the train, yeah (ho-ah)
O-oh, back on the chain gang (ho-ah)
The powers that be
That force us to live like we do
Bring me to my knees
When I see what they've done to you
Well, I'll die as I stand here today
Knowing that deep in my heart
They'll fall to ruin one day
For making us part
I found a picture of you, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Those were the happiest days of my life
Like a break in the battle was your part, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
In the wretched life of a lonely heart
Now I'm back on the train, yeah (ho-ah)
O-oh, back on the chain gang (ho-ah)

So pull me out of this dream
Turn off the television
Put on a romantic vinyl
And come to bed again
Please be my next morning flower
But don't be there all the time
Leave me a couple of hours
Then bring me food and wine
Play with me, play with me
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel
I'll make this week disappear
Like I've erased several months
It's turning into a year now
And I'm still a manikin
You're so poetic when you're sad
So tiring when you cry
We could fly out and get married
I think I love you now
Play with me, play with me
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel
Play with me, play with
Don't tell me how it feels
Don't let it be for real
Don't tell me how you feel

When people call us revolutionary
They're just tryin' to see
All that we choose
When all we want is everybody free
The universe would be one brotherhood
It isn't wrong to be prepared to fight
Together to unite if we believe
In giving everything our heart and soul
Until we reach the goal we should achieve
It shouldn't matter if we're brown or white
Yellow or black as night to anyone
We're all born equal with the self same rights
Sharing the same daylight under the sun
If loving freedom makes me quality
Of opportunity is where revolutionary
Constantly, fervently, firmly
Revolutionary

Ooh, I've been dirt
And I don't care
Ooh, I've been dirt
And I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
'Cause I'm yearning inside
And I'm the fire of life
Yeah alright
Ooh, I've been hurt
And I don't care
Ooh, I've been hurt
And I don't care
'Cause I'm burning inside
'Cause I'm yearning inside
And do you feel it?
Said do you feel it
When you touch me?
I said do you feel it
When you touch me?
I'm fire
Well, it's a fire
Yeah alright
Oh it's just a burning inside
Oh it's just a yearning inside
Said do you feel it?
I said do you feel it
When you cut me?
Said do you feel it
When you cut me?
It's a fire, it's a fire
I'm a fire inside
Oh it's just a dreaming

Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel
He looks out a window without glass
The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
His father beats him 'cause he's too tired to beg
He's got 9 brothers and sisters
They're brought up on their knees
It's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
But that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard
He's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
He's going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, to the dirty boulevard
This room cost 2,000 dollars a month
You can believe it man it's true
Somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
No one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
They dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard
Give me your hungry, your tired your poor I'll piss on 'em
That's what the Statue of Bigotry says
Your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death
And get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard
Get to end up, on the dirty boulevard
Going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, on the dirty boulevard
Going out
Outside it's a bright night
There's an opera at Lincoln Center
Movie stars arrive by limousine
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
But the lights are out on the Mean Streets
A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
He's selling plastic roses for a buck
The traffic's backed up to 39th street
The TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck
And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
He's found a book on magic in a garbage can
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
"At the count of 3" he says, "I hope I can disappear"
And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly away
I want to fly
Fly, fly away
I want to fly
Fly-fly away (Fly a-)
Fly-fly-fly (-way, ooh...)
Fly-fly away (I want to fly-fly away)
Fly away (I want to fly, wow-woh, no, fly away)

I'm home, lost my job, and incurably ill
You think this is easy, realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh no
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me, oh
One more, weekend, of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no (kiss-kiss)
Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers
I've got believers
I've got believers
I've got believers in me
I've got believers
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I am a D.J.

Gimme danger, little stranger
And I'll feel you bleed
Gimme danger, little stranger
And I'll heal your disease
There's nothing in my dreams
But some ugly memories
Kiss me like the ocean breeze
Well if you will be my lover
I will shiver and sing
But if you won't be my master
I will do anything
There's nothing left alive
But some dark glassy eyes
Raise my fears one more time
Come on little danger, die a little stranger
Swear you're gonna feel my hell
Come on little stranger, die a little later
Swear you're gonna feel my hell
Swear you're gonna feel my hell
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Every day
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
I gotta feel it
I gotta feel it
I gotta feel it
You gotta feel it, I gotta feel it
I wanna feel it...

Well they call me a juicy hop frog

They call you hop frog
Well they call you hop frog
Hop frog
Hop froggg

We can be heroes
(Just for one day)

People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans jumped up on the stage
And Lady Stardust sang her songs of darkness and dismay
And he was alright, the band was all together
And he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice, really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long
The femme fatales emerged from shadows to watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs to make their point of view
And I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
And Lady Stardust sang his songs of darkness and dismay
And he was alright, the band was all together
And he was alright, his song went on forever
And he was awful nice, really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long
Oh how I lied when they asked if I knew his name
For he was alright, the band was all together
And he was alright, his song went on forever
And he was awful nice, really quite paradise
And he sang all night long

Like an inventor
He is a symbol of a new age
He glides above the realms
Of you and me
He flows through your life
And makes you feel quite small
You may sit up in your chair
He doesn't care at all
He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
His gowns come from paris
Occasionally from rome
He can go anywhere
Say back to his home
He flows through your life
And makes you feel quite small
Flashing to the white collars
Ha, he doesn't care at all
He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
Please...
He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
He's the man in the middle
You can tell which way he lays
He's the man in the middle
And he realises
And he realises
And he realises
Beauty pays
Please...

In the morning, sounds the alarm
Is it a warning of all the things to come?
On my pillow, there is blood
I try to speak but only think a word
Reflecting windows, by the sun
My mouth is gone.
Well damn the songs I'd sung if I had know, my mouth is gone
When a man without a mouth, lets his dog out.
He just runs away.
It's been so long since he has heard his name.
When a man without a mouth wants to speak, he's got things to say
In my car, I hum the tune along, to a radio song.
When I go to work, it's just like this.
Except there's no smile for the receptionist.
Except I can't smoke my cigarette.
When the boss says I'm late I can't say back its metamorphosis
When a man without a mouth, lets his dog out.
He just runs away.
It's been so long since he has heard his name
When a man without a mouth wants to speak
He's got things to say
When a man without a mouth, lets his dog out.
He just runs away.
It's been so long since he has heard his name

Way down here you need a reason to move
Feel a fool running your stateside games
Lose your load, leave your mind behind Baby Jane
Oh, Mexico
It sounds so simple I just got to go
The sun's so hot I forgot to go home
Guess I'll have to go now
Americano got the sleepy eye
But his body's still shaking like a live wire
Sleepy Se√±orita with the eyes on fire
Oh, Mexico
It sounds so sweet with the sun sinking low
The moon's so bright like to light up the night
Make everything all right
Baby's hungry and the money's all gone
The folks back home don't want to talk on the phone
She gets a long letter, sends back a postcard
Times are hard
Oh, down in Mexico
I never really been so I don't really know
Oh, Mexico
I guess I'll have to go
Oh, Mexico
I never really been but I'd sure like to go
Oh, Mexico
I guess I'll have to go now
Talking 'bout in Mexico
In a honky tonk down in Mexico
Oh, Mexico
Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico
Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico
Mexico, Mexico

No fun my babe
No fun
No fun my babe
No fun
No fun to hang around
Feelin' that same old way
No fun to hang around
Freaked out for another day
No fun my babe
No fun
No fun my babe
No fun
No fun to be alone
Walking by myself
No fun to be alone
In love with somebody else
Well maybe go out, maybe stay home
Maybe call Mom on the telephone
Well c'mon, well c'mon
C'mon c'mon
Now Ron, I say Ron
C'mon and lemme hear you tell em
Lemme hear you tell em
Now I feel
I say lemme hear you
Tell 'em how I feel, yeah, my man
No fun to be alone
It's no fun to be alone
Hang on
Don't you lemme go
It's no fun to alone
To be alone

No sooner had Peter gone
Than a big gray wolf came out of the forest
In a twinkling
The cat climbed up into the tree
The duck quacked and in her excitement
Jumped out of the pond
But no matter how hard the duck tried to run
She couldn't escape the wolf
He was getting nearer, nearer
Catching up with her

Ai-yah
Oh yeah
I'm up on the eleventh floor and I'm watching the cruisers below
Oh well her heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all-time low
He's down on the street and he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
'Cause she's hoping to score, so I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart - walk out of her mind
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
And her frock coat and bibbity-bobbity hat
Oh God I could do better than that
She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking night walking games
Oh and she's known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames
And if she says she can do it then she can do it
She don't make false claims
Oh she's a queen and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on, and she'll lay him right down
Yes she's leading him on, and she'll lay him right down
But it could've been me, yes it could've been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say?
No no no
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
And her frock coat and bibbity-bobbity hat
Oh God I could do better than that
So I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall
The cot feels so cold, it don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while, and look at my hotel wall
And he's down on the street so I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab, 'cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth, but it's no taste at all
It could've been me, oh yes it could've been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say?
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
And her frock coat and bibbity-bobbity hat
Oh God I could do better than that
You betcha
Oh yeah

Dance to the beat
Of the living dead
Lose sleep baby

Raw power is sure to come
A runnin' to you

And you got the shakes
So am I baby
And I got what it takes
Raw power will surely come
Running to you

Raw power can destroy a man
Raw power is more than soul
It's got a son called rock and roll
Raw power honey just won't quit

Raw power baby can't be beat
Poppin' eyes and flashin' feet
Everybody's always tryin' to tell me
What to do
Don't you try
Don 't you try to tell me what to do
Look in the eye
Of the savage girl
Fall deep in love
In the underworld
Raw power is sure to come
Runnin' to you
If you're alone
And you got the fear
So am I baby
Let's move on out of here

Happiness is guaranteed
It was made for you and me
Raw power honey just won't quit
Raw power I can feel it

Raw power honey it don't want to know

Raw power is laughin' at you and me
And this is what I want to know
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Raw power
Can you feel it?

She had an horror of rooms she was tired you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do, and she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again
She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies
She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

My name is Mr. Touchshriek
Of Touchshriek, mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores
And empty females
I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide Internet
He's a broken man, I'm also a broken man
It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Lookin' through windows for demons
Watchin' the young advance in all electric
Some of the houses 'round here still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing
If I had another broken name, oh, I dream of something like that

Test, testing, testing
This, hmm, Grace is my name and, and I was, hm
It was that phot, a fading photograph of
A patch, a patchwork quilt
And they've put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs
So I'm thinking very, too, bit too fast like a brain hatch
And, ah, they won't let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop, popular musics and aftershocks
I've been watching a television of, um, in the homelands
That's the new homelands and, um, and that's all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horrid

Ramona is so cold
When she broke it off with Leon
She said, "The ring is enough
I don't wanna see his face again"
Ramona was so cold

Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, engines on
Check ignition and may God's love be with you
Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five,
Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
For here
Am I floating round my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows"
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you...
"Here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do."

Supergirl Maybe I can't kill you off after all
Supergirl I don't want to kill you off after all
Open hands catch the light you're after
Breathe again fill the moon with laughter
Kill the man in his house of infidels
Supergirl so unflagging in your glow after all
Supergirl you're the strongest girl I know after all
Open hands catch the light you're after
Breathe again fill the moon with laughter
Kill the man in his house of infidels
Destined thousand names have burned tonight
Come watch them from the shore and there' still time
For you to run away and not come back no more
Just don't regret a thing
'Cause I don't regret a thing
Open hands catch the light you're after
Breathe again fill the moon with laughter
Kill the man in his house of infidels

Cold I am, tonight I am
Tomorrow's really on my mind
Sure to think of, from now on
The things will move more slowly
But thin is thin and chances slim
And sometimes we all have those dreams
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Safe in this skyline
Safe, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
In this skyline
The past it almost shimmers now

How to make amends for the things they said
The girls avoid the stormy sky
But I and my cloudy face
Will be gone, high-tailing out of here
Is the lights a-blazing in their lonely town?
I love the little cars at dawn
But I and my heathen heart
Will be lain upon some foreign shore
Here's the saddest Joe on the corner of the town
"Listen to the words!" he cries
I love him in his craziness, his tatters and his courage
He'll thumb his nose at the straight and true
When the boys come marching home
They'll fly his rags from the highest tree
When the boys come marching home
(When the boys come marching home)
(Home, marching home)
Aching for some innocence and peace of mind
While the moon pulls up its net of souls
The sun presses down on my brave new world
But, in truth, I don't feel brave at all
Leave it all behind me to the townies and the wags
The kids who never learned to smile
While I and the cobbled nag I ride
Stumble down another weary mile
Here's to those who cluster,
Walking through the wars
The girls who never close till dawn
They rag upon the feeble
And they swan around the stronger
But their eyes are fixed on the edge of town
When the boys come marching home
They'll slide from view - tiny, two by two
When the boys come marching home
(Home, marching home)
(Home, marching home)
When the boys come marching home
(When the boys come marching home)
Boys come marching home
(Home, marching home)
(Home, when the boys come marching home)
(Home, marching home)
(Home)
(When the boys come marching home)

Heaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way
When you're a boy
Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry
When you're a boy
When you're a boy
You can wear a uniform
When you're a boy
Other boys check you out
You get a girl
These are your favourite things
When you're a boy
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out
Uncage the colours
Unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When you're a boy
They'll never clone ya
You're always first on the line
When you're a boy
When you're a boy
You can buy a home of your own
When you're a boy
Learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

There was a time, the laughing time
I took my heart to every party
They'd point my way
"How are you today? "
"Will you make us laugh? chase our blues away? "
Their funny man won't let them down
No, he'd dance and prance and be their clown
That time, the laughing time
When even a fool learns to love
The clown turned around
And saw her smile, oh how she loved me
She'd clap her hands and beg me stay
To make her laugh, to make her life gay
Who wants the love of all the world
When here was love in the eyes of just one girl
That day, that precious day
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love
That day, that hateful day
The joke turned stale, the game was over
Those spiteful words "oh, go away. who wants to play? "
"It's getting late now."
My world, my funny world
Had lost it's mask and shown a broken heart
A time, a sour time
When even a fool learns to love
But oh, how I dreamed, a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
I'll stay with my dream, it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes for ever and ever
What d'you say?
Du, k√∂nntest du schwimmen
Wie Delphine, Delphine es tun
Niemand gibt uns eine Chance
Doch k√∂nnen wir siegen f√ºr immer und immer
Und wir sind dann Helden f√ºr einen Tag
Ich, ich bin dann K√∂nig
Und du, du K√∂nigin
Obwohl sie unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir Helden f√ºr einen Tag
Wir sind dann wir an diesem Tag
Ich, ich glaubte zu tr√§umen (zu tr√§umen)
Die Mauer im R√ºcken war kalt (so kalt)
Sch√ºsse rei√üen die Luft (rei√üen die Luft)
Doch wir k√ºssen, als ob nichts geschieht (nichts geschieht)
Und die Scham fiel auf ihrer Seite
Oh, wir k√∂nnen sie schlagen f√ºr alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden f√ºr diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Oh oh oh oh

"You know who I am," he said.
The speaker was an angel:
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings,
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going."
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger,
Driven by the night,
Till you come."
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
See it in my eyes
Till you come."
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
Driven by the night,
Till you come"
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
"Look back in anger
Feel it in my voice,
Till you come."

Here comes Johnny yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And the flesh machine
He's gonna do another strip tease
Hey man where'd you get that lotion?
I been hurting since I bought that gimmick
About something called love

The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff
From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkhuth
There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stains
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here
Well, it's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here

Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand,
Jack is in his coat, and Jane is her vest, and, me,
I'm in a rock'n'roll band. Huh!
Ridin' in a Stutz-Bearcat, Jim
Y'know, those were different times!
Oh, all the poet, they studied rules of verse,
And the ladies, they rolled their eyes.
Sweet Jane! Whoa! Sweet Jane, oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!
I'll tell you something,
Jack, he is a banker,
And Jane, she is a clerk.
Both of them save their monies, ha,
And when, when they come home from work!
Ooh! Sittin' down by the fire, oh!
The radio does play,
The classical music there, Jim.
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers".
All you protest kids.
You can hear Jack say, get ready, ah,
Sweet Jane! Come on baby now! Sweet Jane! Oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!
Some people, they like to go out dancing,
And other peoples, they have to work. Just watch me now!
And there's even some evil mothers,
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt.
Y'know that, women, never really faint,
And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!
And that, y'know, children are the only ones who blush!
And that, life is, just to die!
And, everyone who ever had a heart, oh,
That wouldn't turn around and break it.
And anyone who ever played a part, whoa,
And wouldn't turn around and hate it!
Sweet Jane! Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane.
Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane.
Heavenly wine and roses,
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles. ah,
Heavenly wine and roses,
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles. hey!

La-la-la-la-la-la,

He's quadraphonic, he's a

One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way
Be with my baby, then
We'll spend some time together

My baby's in there someplace

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

Let me put my arms around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh, babe, it'll be all right
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fallout saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
That stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Where once had raged a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday, yeah
Yeah
Drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
Drive, drive-in Saturday (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a drive-in Saturday, yeah (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)

Well, Annie's pretty neat

The boys in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy,
And his sellings thorny crown
I loved her!

I've got to get away,

Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're far too un-kind
She loves to love all beauty,
And she says the norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
When she finds she has no money
I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now,
But I loved her!
Ah!
Oh-oh-oh

I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man love is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head

He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions, they followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Putting on some clothes, I made my way to school
I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights
Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table, a gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit, he'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust," I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Ow

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe, but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just turn on with me, and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands

Well, the joint was rocking
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down
Well it sounded so sweet
I had to take me a chance
I rose out of my seat
And had to dance
I started moving my feet
And clapping my hands
Yeah, we kept on rocking
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down
About twelve o'clock
When the place was packed
The front doors were locked
I said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But kept on rocking
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down
Yeah
About twelve o'clock
Around lock up time
Well, the doors were locked
Said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But it kept on rocking
Going round 'n' round
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking
'Til the moon went down

Going round 'n' round

Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you..."
"Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do"

And so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like they hope it was
And the Goodmen Tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of Brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighing, the swirl through the streets
Like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our Wings that Bark
Flashing teeth of Brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, And we were Gone
Hanging out with your Dwarf Men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions
I was Stone and he was Wax
So he could scream, and still relax, unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Through our veins and Lo! it was midnight
Back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today
And it was Stalking time for the Moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
In the Devil-may-be-here
But He can't sing about that
Oh, And we were Gone
Real Cool Traders
We were so Turned On
You thought we were Fakers
Now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The Factor Max that proved the fact
Is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
Now my Brother lays upon the Rocks
He could be dead, He could be not
He could be You
He's Chameleon, Comedian, Corinthian and Caricature
Shooting-up Pie-in-the-Sky
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the Bad
Bewlay Brothers
In the Blessed and Cold
In the Crutch-hungry Dark
Was where we flayed our Mark
Oh, and we were Gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so Turned On
In the Mind-Warp Pavilion
Lay me place and bake me Pie
I'm starving for me Gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked
I might just slip away, hey
Just for the Day, Hey!
Hey, Please come Away, Hey!
Just for the Day, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey!
Just for the Day
Please come Away
Please come Away
Please come Away
Please come Away
Away
(Away)
Away
Hey

We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long, long time ago
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years & years, I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died alone, a long, long time ago
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace, child
I moved up to take a place
Near you
So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart
In pieces
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day, though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
Prettiest star
One day, though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star

White light - White light gonna drive me out of my brain
White light - White light gonna make me feel so insane
White heat - White heat shapin' them down to my toes
White light - White light's got it now, goodness knows
White light - White light gonna drive me out of my mind
White light - White light's surely gonna make me blind
White heat - White heat shaping way down to my toes
White light - White light could kill me now, goodness knows
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white heat
Oh, oh, white heat
White light - White light gonna drive me out of my brain
White light - White light gonna make me feel so insane
White heat - White heat shapin' them down to my toes
White light - White light's got it now, goodness knows
White light - White light gonna drive me out of my mind
White light - White light's surely gonna make me blind
White heat - White heat shaping way down to my toes

Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white heat
Oh, oh, white heat
White light's a-flashing
White light
Still feels right
What's that sound, what's that sound
Don't turn on, be dead or alive
No feeling
Here she comes
Oww, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) here she comes
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the wild eyed boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smoulders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh it's the madness in his eyes
As he breaks the night to cry:
It's really me
Really you
And really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you
And really me
You'll lose me though I'm always really free
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realise
Where the snow had saved a place
For the wild eyed boy from Freecloud
And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the wide-eyed boy from Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand
And the magic in the stare
Of the wild eyed boy said
Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face of the wise boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of the Swedish room
Of Hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise
Some things we could do
In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An occasional dream
And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
'Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago, long ago
And I still can't touch your name
For the days of fate were strong for you
Danced you far from me
In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream (time)
Of mine

I took this walk to ease my mind
To find out what's gnawing at me
Wouldn't think to look at me
That I've spent a lot of time in education
It all seems so long ago
I'm a thinker, not a talker
I've no one to talk to anyway
I can't see the road
For the rain in my eyes
I live above the grocers' store
Owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English
Tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation
I stand without a word to say
I can't see the bridge
For the rain in my eyes
And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in twos or threes or more
While the lamp that shines above the grocers' store
Investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfill their needs just by being there
And my hands shake, my head hurts
My voice sticks inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb
And no one will recall me
And I can't see the water
For the tears in my eyes

I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you that sets the test
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
"I gave Them life, I gave Them all
They drained my very soul dry
I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts to be free?
Words of strength and care and sympathy
I opened doors that would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me"
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you that sets the test
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream
Where all is God and God is just a word
"We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood, we planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers, sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yeah, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor on slogans such as
'Wish You Could Hear'
'Love Is All We Need'
'Kick Out The Jams'
'Kick Out Your Mother'
'Cut Up Your Friend'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'
And We know the Flag of Love is from above
And We can force you to be free
And We can force you to believe"
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
"I believe in the Power of Good.
I Believe in the State of Love.
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right.
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right."
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I Want to believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to believe
There's a light shining through somehow
And I want to believe
And you want to believe
And we want to believe
And we want to live
Oh, we want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
Live
Live
Live

Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Yeah
Don't sit down
Don't sit down
Don't sit down

I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today
Then she moved toward the exit, clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart, it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears, the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor
Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
Hey

Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand
Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all
You're fey, Janine
A trouper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown
So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do? 
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you
They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well, so do I
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay
He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake? 
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you

The children of the summer's end gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the London sky resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven
Touch, we touched the very soul of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head and away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd and we walked back to the road, unchained
The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party

"Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
"Ground Control to Major Tom (10, 9, 8, 7, 6)
Commencing countdown, engines on (5, 4, 3, 2)
Check ignition and may God's love be with you (1, lift off)
"This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare"
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
"For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
"Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much" - "She knows.
"Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you..."
"Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do"

Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last
It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
I'm the cream
Of the Great Utopia Dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen
I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm 
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me 
Quite amazed
As I'm unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed
I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me 
Quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your father
Quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed

Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the wild eyed boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft

Blows his pipe of smoulders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some

Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track

Weaving down a by-road
Singin' the song
That's my kind of high road
Gone wrong
My-my
Smile at least
You can't say no to
The Beauty and the Beast
Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong
But darling something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside here
Someone could get skinned
How?
My-my
Someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Darling
My-my
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Liebling
My-my
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should
My-my
Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank God Heaven left us
Standing on our feet
My-my
Beauty and the Beast
My-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Darling

Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely

You
You walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
Your scalding face
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
Too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands
Get me to a doctor's I've been told
Someone's back in town
The chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence
And my honour's at stake
The weather's grim ice on the cages
Me I'm Robin Hood and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming
If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
In the rain
Get me to the doctor
Get me off the streets (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Get me off the streets
Get some protection
Get me on my feet
While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure
To the blackout
Get me on my feet
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets (get some protection)

Baby, I've been
Breaking glass in your room again
Listen 
Don't look at the carpet
I drew something awful on it
See
You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems
I'll never touch you

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame
(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(Get me some, fame)
(Now get-ah, fame)

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Just for one day

Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people
And all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice cream parlour
Drinking milk shakes, cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years

My death waits like an old "rou√©"
So confident I'll go his way
Whistle to him and the passing time...
My death waits like a bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
We drank for that - and the passing time...
My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as our love is bright
Let's not think of that or the passing time...
But whatever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do...
Angel or devil, I don't care
For in front of that door... there is you.
My death waits like a beggar blind
Who sees the world through an unlit mind
Throw him a dime for the passing time...
My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
Let's not think about the passing time
My death waits there between your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Let's not think about the passing time...
But what ever lies behind the door,
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil I don't care
For in front of that door... There is you
My death waits there among the leaves
In magician's mysterious sleeves
Rabbits and dogs and the passing time...
My death waits there among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow cowers
Let's pick lilacs for the passing time...
My death waits there, in a double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
Let's not think about the passing time...
But whatever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil... I don't care
For in front of that door
There is... me

"Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
"Ground Control to Major Tom (10, 9, 8, 7, 6)
Commencing countdown, engines on (5, 4, 3, 2)
Check ignition and may God's love be with you (1, lift off)
"This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare"
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
"For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
"Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much" - "She knows.
"Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you..."
"Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do"

Time, he's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy
Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy
Time, in Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think 
Oh God I'm still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now

You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed, your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

Taking you nowhere, angel

Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come, get up, my baby)
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come, get up, my baby)
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car, twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon wish upon day upon day, I believe, oh, Lord
I believe all the way
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
I'll stick with you, baby, for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold

The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff
From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkhuth
There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stains
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here
Well, it's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late

This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too
Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants so much to
"Stay," that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is "stay this time"
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me, with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind

In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
I don't need another change, still you forced away into my scheme of things
You say we're growing, growing heart and soul
In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again, you're born once again for me
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in heaven or hell
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?
In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Just as long as I can see, I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still flowing
Just as long as I can walk
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things

In the valley of the dead man walks

Fed into the featherfall
Fed him on a pedestal
Carving you will never get
Shine shine shine

Bleed like a craze, Dad

Seek for a leather journey
Never stopped to think about
Hollywood King Kong

Looking to the parlous parlours
Party on the dead
Put a net through his headache
Shine shine shine

Blee-eed, bleed like a craze, Dad

All the Shirley/Charley films on film
Come together, party

Living in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies
Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain
So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane
Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way
With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustn't crumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never born, so I'll never get old
So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane
Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way

And when she drowns
Within and in the fizzy gin, begins to sigh
"Good god" or "My" I cry and die and lie beside
She is the apple in my eye
She talked to God
I couldn't cope
Or'd hope eloped
A dope, she roped
This salty lie
And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her
Telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it
And deep my wound
Within for every second chance it was 
thy-tore
From deep within, despite the rain, my words are worn
She loves to talk into the phone
No matter who
No matter when
No matter where
No better than the faulty line
And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her
Telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it

Is said to be
The union of Christ
And his bride, the Christian
It's all very puzzling
Sex and the church

All the great mystic religions
Put strong emphasis, on
Redeaming spiritual qualities

About sex
Of sex, of sex, of sex, of sex

Between the flesh and the spirit
It's sex and the church

You, you, you
You, you, you
All our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun
No peachy prayers
No trendy rechauff√©
I'm with you
So I can't go on
All my violence
Raining tears upon the sheet
I'm bewildered
For we're strangers when we meet
Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you
Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes
All my violence
Raining tears upon the sheet
I'm resentful
For we're strangers when we meet
Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new
Your embrace
Was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu
Steely resolve
Is falling from me
My poor soul
All bruised passivity
All your regrets
Ride rough-shod over me
I'm so glad
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover
For we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over
But we're strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet

In mornings she's so regal that the valley sighs
In the chilly sea that killed her real slows
Now we're swimming up farther with the doll by our sides 
Fill the cup with these sleepy souls
Shimi Kapoor
It's clear that some things never take
Shimi Kapoor
Please heal these tears
Shimi Kapoor 
She will feel like at tea make me laugh all along
With such feats like sex only brought upon
Ooh lady, ooh baby, maybe I'll live my lies alone
Jesus, up here, hear me, I, up up up up oh ah
Shimi Kapoor
It's clear that some things never take

Please heal these tears

Whilst flying through an azure cloud
A crystal girl I'd spy
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue
And stuttered as she sighed
I wish to sing the chicken song
Ching-a-ling song is fine
I'd give my jewels and caviar
To make this daydream mine
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
Doo dah doo doo dah dah, doo dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
While stepping through a heaven's eye
Two lover souls we spied
They wished the cloud boys sang to me
A cheerful happy cry
We love to play our love-strong hearts
No better do we know
No gifts of money do we give
For love is all we own
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling

Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red 
Rich men's children running past 
Their fathers dressed in hose 
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes 
Gazing eyes and running wild 
Past the stocks and over stiles 
Kiss the window merry child 
But come and buy my toys 
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn 
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn 
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill 
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will 
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys 
Leave the parsley on the stalls 
Come and buy my toys 
You shall own a cambric shirt 
You shall work your father's land 
But now you shall play in the market square 
Till you'll be a man 
Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red

Did you ever have a dream or two
Where the hero is a guy named you
And the things he does are just too much
Does he fly like Mr. Superman, speak Chinese, French and Dutch?
And did you ever have a dream or two?
Have you ever woken up one day
With the feeling that you'd been away?
If the girl that you dreamed of last night
Had the same dream, in the very same scene
With the very same boy, hold tight
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge
I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If you've got the secret, tell me do
Have you ever had a dream or two?
Have you ever had a dream or two?

The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I'll watch them sink before your gaze
Senjorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love like a ragged soldier
Catching butterflies
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh I'm so much in love like the little boy
Who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang
Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
'Cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang
Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang
This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang

Fingertips sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut furs that hide behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in a tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor 
He's cloaked and clothed in saffran robes, his beads are all he owns
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man
Fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war, a gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been, I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder,
Because the years of threading daisies lie behind you now.
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told.
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and paints and beads.
I will show you games where the winner never wins.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key,
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals.
We shall drink the oldest wine, and velvet skies will linger.
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free.
I will hold a lighted lamp, and we shall walk together.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Your darkened eyes throw mystery,
But your lips are void of history.
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you?
I will give you dreams,
And I'll tell you things you'd like to hear.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Let me sleep beside you.

War made him a soldier 
Little Frankie Mear 
Peace left him a loser 
The little bombardier 
Lines of worry appeared with age 
Unskilled hands that knew no trade 
Spent his time in the picture house 
The little bombardier 
Frankie drank his money 
The little that he made 
Told his woes to no man 
Friendless, lonely days 
Then one day, in the ABC 
Four bright eyes gazed longingly 
At the ice-cream in the hand of 
The little bombardier 
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days 
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze 
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy 
Two young children had changed his aims 
He gave them toffees and played their games 
He brought them presents with every coin he made 
Then two gentlemen called on him 
Asked him for his name 
Why was he friends with the children 
Were they just a game? 
Leave them alone or we'll get sore 
We've had blokes like you in the station before 
The hand of authority said "no more" to 
The little bombardier 
Packed his bags, his heart in pain 
Wiped a tear and caught a train 
Not to be seen in the town again 
The little bombardier

Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door, I'll wave my flag and shout
Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid, it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool
Oh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry
Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Well, I might be able to stretch it till Wednesday

This girl is made of lipstick 
Powder and paint 
Sees the pictures of herself 
Every magazine on every shelf 
This girl is maid of Bond Street 
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives 
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs 
This girl is a lonely girl 
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus 
Buys the Daily News 
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her 
This girl is made of loneliness 
A broken heart 
For the boy that she once knew 
Doesn't want to know her any more 
And this girl is a lonely girl 
Every thing she wants is hers 
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with 
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy 
Jealousy 
He doesn't have a limousine 
Really wants to be a star himself 
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor 
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars 
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

There's a little churchyard just along the way
Used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers, all that jazz
Till the war came along, and someone dropped a bomb on the lot
And in this little yard, there's a little old man 
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand 
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves 
He hates the reverend vicar, and he lives all alone, in his home 
Ah-choo... excuse me...
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed 
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed 
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care 
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair 
And you put it in your pocket 
God, it's pouring down...
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy 
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys 
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell 
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket 
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day 
Stand... achoo...
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave 
Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay 
And I was the wicked man who took her life away 
Very selfish, Oh God 
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell 
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself 
I've started digging holes, my friend
And this one here's for you 
"Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it 
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl 
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain"

Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand
Rubber Band
In 1910, I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh
Rubber Band
Won't you play your haunting theme again to me?
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
Oh, play that theme
Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in library parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love
Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh
spoken:
Oh sob, I hope you break your baton

La la la la la la

A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 
Jack Frost took her hand and left me
Jack Frost ain't so cool 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away 
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday 
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
See my eyes, my window pane 
See my tears like gentle rain 
That's the memory of a summer day 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
La la la la la la (repeat)

She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house.
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
And never took her out.
She wore a trench coat, khaki.
Her hobnail boots were full of holes.
She's got medals.
Her mother called her "Mary," but she changed her name to "Tommy,"
She's a one... oh.
She went and joined the army,
Passed the medical; don't ask me how it's done.
They sent her to the front line,
Fighting for her country's name.
She's got medals.
She got very tired of picking up girls,
Cleaning her gun, and shaving her curls.
Then the enemy dropped a bomb.
Survivors there were none.
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead.
She'd deserted on the previous morning.
Replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green.
Called herself Eileen.
Came to London town.
Now she's settled down.
She's got medals.

Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Potala lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule

Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly Boy Blue, Blue
Silly Boy Blue
You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die

Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song

If I find a girl he'll take her away

Waste of flippin' time, take a look at my life and you'll see
Take a quick, butchers, rotten Harry down the hall
Wouldn't give me tuppence for him

I was walking down the high street,
When I heard footsteps behind me.
And there was a little old man (
Hello!
)
In scarlet and gray, chuckling away
Well he trotted back to my house
And he sat beside the telly (
Ah!
)
With his tiny hands on his tummy
Chuckling away, laughing all day
"I ought to report you to the Gnome Office."
"Gnome Office? Ahahahah!"
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me,
Said the laughing gnome
Well I gave him roasted toadstools,
And a glass of dandelion wine. (
*burp* Pardon...
)
Then I put him on a train to Eastbourne.
Carried his bag, and gave him a fag.
"Have you got a light, boy?"
"Here, where do you come from?"
"Gnome-man's land, heehee!"
"Oh, really?"
In the morning, when I woke up,
He was sitting on the edge of my bed,
With his brother, whose name was Fred.
He'd brought him along to sing me a song.
"All right, let's hear it... 'ere, what's that clicking noise?"
"That's Fred, he's a metro-gnome, haha!"
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
"Oh now, I'm a gnome, anyway, haha!"
"Haven't you got a home to go to?"
"No, we are gnome-ads, hehe!"
"Didn't they teach you to get your hair cut at school? You look like a rolling gnome."
"Nah, not at the London school of Eco-gnome-ics."
Now they're staying up me chimney,
And we're living on caviar and honey (
Hurray!
)
'Cause they're earning me lots of money
Writing comedy prose for radio shows
"It's the, errrr... it's the gnome-service, yes, of course!"
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee

Bow Bells strike another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away
Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you
Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys
You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys
A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, 'cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys

There is a happy land where only children live 
They don't have the time to learn the ways 
Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves 
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite 
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike 
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him 
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us 
Mother calls, but we don't hear 
There's lots more things to do 
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet 
But we will be, very shortly 
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry 
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky 
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away 
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray 
There is a happy land where only children live 
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup

Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 
Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum 
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days 
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother

Here is the news:
According to the latest world population survey,
Figures have reached danger point, my god!
London: 15 million 75 thousand.
New York: 80 million.
Paris: 15 million and 30.
China: 1000 million.
Billington-Spa: lots!
My studies include exophagy.
I formed my own society,
To crush the power of fecundity.
The world will overpopulate,
Unless you claim infertility.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel 
That they are not infertible.
The crops of few, the cattle gun.
There's only one way to linger on.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
Achtung, achtung! These are your orders:
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air 
Will be slaughtered and cremated.
Only one cubic foot of air is allowed...
I've prepared a document legalising mass abortion.
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide.
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
You don't seem to hear me clear.
Do I talk above your sphere? 
Let me explain my project, dear,
Show you how I'll save the world,
Or let it die within the year.
Why do you look that way at me, your Messiah?
We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.
We are hungry men.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to eat you.

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me 
Riding on a golden horse 
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you 
Happy at the sound of your voice 
Maybe I'll slay a dragon for you 
Or banish wicked giants from the land 
But you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you 
We will only love each other as forever 
When I live my dream 
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 
And the empty man you left behind 
It's a broken heart that dreams
It's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream 
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 
Wish, and the storm will fade away 
Wish again, and you will stand before me
While the sky will paint an overture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream 
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me 
Let me be the one to understand 
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me 
Then we can live in our new land 
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream...

Once there was a fellow and his name was Buzz
He was just a rookie cop, just a baby Fuzz
He patroled the Sunset Strip in the land of the free and the home of the hip
He protected you and me until he met a girl called Alice D
Alice was the girl that all the hippies dread
And they called her sweet Alice the head
Alice it was plain to see, was full of pot and LSD
She'd attract a great big crowd, because her inner piece was much too loud
Good Buzz did the thing that good Fuzz must
Stuck his gun in Alice's back and said "This is a bust"
Shone the flashlight in her eyes, she began to hypnotise
Buzz said "What a wild sensation, guess this must be hallucination"
Love is so sensational, when you fall in love with eyes dilational
Now they're taking pills in shops, Buzz is not afraid of Watts
Buzz and Alice D have shown the way of where the fuzz might be some day
Buzz is still a cop of course, he's the pusher on the porch
He's protecting you and me from evil women like poor Alice D

Columbine my frail design
I see you see me standing on my own
Is it you that I'm walking through
Should I retrace my point of view
I'm left in clouded dreams of finding who
Not Columbine
Just incase you're my disguise
I found yourself to my surprise
I'm on the ground
And it's Harlequin who fix me up
Who catches you
Who wanishes me
From finding who
You are

People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight (second time: really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long
Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight (second time: really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long
Oh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight (second time: really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long

I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man
Hey white boy, what you doin' in town
Hey white boy, chasin' all the women around
Oh pardon me, sir, it's the last thing on my mind
I'm just looking for a good friend of mine
I'm waiting for the man
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Real shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for the man
Big dirty building, up three flights of stairs
Nobody stops you 'cause nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Then you gotta split because he's got no time to waste
I'm waiting for the man
Baby, don't you holler, darlin', don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow but that's just another time
I'm waiting for the man
I'm waiting for the man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 1-2-5
So sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man
Waiting for the man
To welcome me home

The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I'll watch them sink before your gaze
Senjorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love like a ragged soldier
Catching butterflies
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh I'm so much in love like the little boy
Who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

Fingertips sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut furs that hide behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in a tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor 
He's cloaked and clothed in saffran robes, his beads are all he owns
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man
Fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war, a gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been, I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Life is a circus
It's not fair
Life is a hard road
When you're not there
At the fair
Friends come to see me
[And the ...](point where shall I go)
To see the show
(To help my friend and foe)
(All that ..)
When will they realize
(To laugh and drag my name on the ground)
The circus must go
(Looking at the strengths of every)
???
Papa he talks to me
Don't try your heart
Gets deep inside you
Does you real harm
Don't you care?
Life ??
(And the ...)
Stand straight and true
(To help my friend and foe)
[Why let them ](Oh let them fight)
Fight your
Christ don't tell

Once upon a time there was a toy soldier
And he lived in the play room
Once upon a time there was a toy soldier
With a whip lash in his hand
And every night little girl Sadie would take all her clothes off
And wind up the toy soldier and he'd raise his whip and say to her:
"On your knees little Sadie
Little Sadie on your knees
Taste the whip in love not given lightly
Taste the whip and bleed for me"
Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she run home from school each day
Little Sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she'd lock the door so she could play
Little Sadie got ambitious
And wound the clockwork soldier tighter
So he could whip her harder and harder
"On your knees little Sadie
Little Sadie on your knees
Taste the whip in love not given lightly
Taste the whip and bleed for me"
One day Sadie wound and wound
And wound and wound
And wound and wound
Till suddenly the little toy soldier's spring, went (boing) (screams)
And he beat her to death! (explosions) (nose blowing)
(Speaking Clock)
"At the first stroke it will be two twenty-one and twenty seconds"

London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Gigi, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi
Take me away
Gigi, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi
Take me today
The boys in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy,
And his sellings thorny crown
I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away,
But I loved her!
Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're far too un-kind
She loves to love all beauty,
And she says the norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
When she finds she has no money
I loved her!
I loved her!
I've got to get away now,
But I loved her!
Ah!
Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Ah
Oh-oh-oh
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta
Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, London bye ta-ta
Oh, eh

And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
She gave them life,
She gave them all
They drained her very soul dry... dry
Hey hey hey bitter girl
We're out to sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
It's easy
Don't be so bitter
Oh oh oh crazy girl
You gave too much and you got nothing
Too many problems and not one thing
In return
Left high and dry
Door
And as the sun rise stream
Flickers on
She finds lavender
To fight the beckoning

The words I have to say
May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do
Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No-one can offer you more
You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen?
You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But there's no other way
So now it's really up to you
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But there's no other way
So now it's really up to you
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door, I'll wave my flag and shout
Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid, it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool
Oh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry
Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Well, I might be able to stretch it till Wednesday

Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note saying 'wish you were here
I know the best ways to break out of here
I helped a young laddie called Ivan
I bundled him over the wall last night
Then he climbed back and he grabbed me tight
He uttered some words that I can't say to you
'Cause he remembered that he was a screw
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave 'em a note wishing 'Happy New Year'
My name is Henry though some say I'm thick
I've spent half me life in and out of nick
Me mum sends me presents to keep me in style
Soggy old cakes and hundreds of files
Now I sussed all them files I'm a clever young man
Now I'm just stupid with manicured hands
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Nobody's left and the screw are in tears
spoken:
"Double 3,427 ?" "Here, sir."
"Double 3,428 ?" "Here, sir."
"Double 3,429? Double 3,429 - Where is he?"
"He went out for a cup of tea at the local football match, sir."
"Oh. well he might have invited me..."
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Nbody's slept and the screws are in tears
We tried digging tunnels but gave up the ghost just past the Kensington yards at the most
Our limbs was aching, we felt pretty pooped
Our clothes they was tatty, our arrows did droop.
We crawled back to safety, our hearts filled with gloom
'Cause we'd dug ourselves through to the smallest room
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Note wishing 'Happy New Year'
spoken:
(SFX: knock knock knock)
"Hello, who is it?"
"Double 3,429, guv"
"Oh, hang on a minute...
(SFX: Doors opening)

Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Potala lanes

Baby, you can own two hearts
Baby, don't try to tear me apart
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise
Baby, you can't fool around
Baby, can't turn me upside down
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise
It's just a matter of time before you call him on the phone
Tell him please, please leave him alone
Please leave him alone
It's just a matter of time, call him on the phone
Tell him please, please leave him alone
Please leave him alone
Baby, you've got me used
Baby, Can't you be like you?
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise
(Ad lib to end)

Wash your face before your faded make-up makes a mark
The mirror will watch over you
Pierrot never comes so pack your face and chase the dark
The mirror's hung up on you
Don't be last, your friends and your reflection
It's all so direction now
Poor Harlequin, you're quite an exception
Fay troubadour, on a downer
Gay Harlequin, doesn't believe in you
Doesn't believe it's true, such a downer.

Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot
Happy little feet that dance all day
Lonely little heart with lots to say
Stepping footprints on your mind
Offering thoughts of Columbine
Bang the drum and blow the bugle call
Pierrot takes the stage to play for all
For here's a life his fortune rules
Forsaken by his Columbine
Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot
To tap his feet to greet dear Harlequin
The hearts of folks so keenly hard to win
A patchwork frame of tears and wine
The nectar for cruel Columbine
The part of three and leaves the stage forlorn
Puppets cold, their faces sad and drawn
Relive each trial of rise and fall
The love which lacks between us all
Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero, Threepenny Pierrot
Threepenny Pierrot - we love you
Threepenny Pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness, gay time eyes
Comical hero ... Threepenny Pierrot

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me 
Riding on a golden horse 
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you 
Happy at the sound of your voice 
Maybe I'll slay a dragon for you 
Or banish wicked giants from the land 
But you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you 
We will only love each other as forever 
When I live my dream 
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 
And the empty man you left behind 
It's a broken heart that dreams
It's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream 
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 
Wish, and the storm will fade away 
Wish again, and you will stand before me
While the sky will paint an overture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream 
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me 
Let me be the one to understand 
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me 
Then we can live in our new land 
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream...

Please trip them gently
They don't like to fall
(Oh by jingo)
There's no room for anger
We're all very small
(Oh by jingo)
We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies
From paradise
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball
Won't someone invite them
They're just taller children
That's all
After all
Man is an obstacle
Sad as the clown
(Oh by jingo)
So hold onto nothing
And he won't let you down
(Oh by jingo)
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone
Others are running
The smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence
They're just older children
That's all
After all
I sing with impertinence
Shading impermanent chords
With my words
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called
But the thought just occurred
That we're nobody's children
After all
Live till your rebirth
And do what you will
(Oh by jingo)
Forget all I've said
Please bear me no ill
(Oh by jingo)
After all
After all

Day after day
They send my friends away
To mansions cold and grey
To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground
Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where it's pointless to be high
'Cause it's such a long way down
So I tell them that
I can fly, I will scream
I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand
Foot in hand
Talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all
Am I?
Don't set me free
I'm as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my E.S.T. makes three
'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me
(Where can the horizon lie
When a nation hides
Its organic minds
In a cellar
Dark and grim
They must be very dim)
Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that it's real
Then ask me how I feel
Here I stand
Foot in hand
Talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all
Don't set me free
I'm as helpless as can be
My libido's split on me
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy
'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men
Roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content
They're all as sane as me

Listen Lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be lie-high-high-high-high-high, my! Oh my!
Slowly, we get too good and too holy
Helping one another, just a righteous brother
Night time, get me back in the night time
I don't want to be angel, just a little bit evil
I feel the devil in me
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
Let go of me

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be

I count the corpses on my left 
I find I'm not so tidy
So I better get away
Better make it today
I've cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I can't control it
My face is drawn
My instinct still emotes it
I slash them cold
I kill them dead
I broke the gooks
I cracked their heads
I'll bomb them out from under the beds
But now I've got the running gun blues
It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left generals squashed and stifled
But I'll slip out again tonight
'Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And I'll plug a few civilians
I'll slash them cold
I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks
I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red
But now I've got the running gun blues

President Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand, gave their pledge
So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine
They called it the Prayer, its answer was law
Its logic stopped war, gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom
Please don't believe in me, please disagree with me
Life is too easy, a plague seems quite feasible now
Or maybe a war, or I may kill you all
Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine
I need you flying, and I'll show that dying
Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind
Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

We met upon a hill
The night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother, she blew my brain
I will go back again
My God, she shook my cold
I had no time to spare
I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she caved my head
Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told
I was very smart
Broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins
I was quick on the ball
Left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying
Then she took my head
Smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly
Kept me going around
So she don't know I crave her so
I'll give my love in vain
To reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother, she blew my brain
I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold

We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long, long time ago
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years & years, I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died alone, a long, long time ago
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with superfear 
Their endless tragic lives
Could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity
Wondrous beings chained to life
Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries
Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh
A chance to die
To turn to mold
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies

In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know."
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too
So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Tell me when you're sad
I wanna make it cool again
I know you're feeling bad
Tell me when you're cool again
Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
We fly through the night
The tears on your lips
Life has your mind and soul
It spins on your hips
Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
You look at me and you weep for the free blue sky
I look to the stars as they flicker and float in your eyes
And under these wings of steel
The small town dies
Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me

Cutting through the water
Hands upon the ghost
To the city of solid iron
Through the kingdom of the ghost
Send your friend away now
Let him sail back home tonight
Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
No one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
Silent as Georges Rodenbach
Mist and silhouette
Girl, you move like water
You've got stars upon your head
You've got my name and number
You've got to take the floor
Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
No one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space

Something like Tobacco Road
Living on a lonely road
I will pull you out of there
We will go to Finchley Fair
I will buy you feather hat
I will steal a cricket bat
Smash some windows, make a noise
We will run with dirty boys
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the dye is cast
When the dye is cast and you have no choice
We will run with dirty boys
We all go mad, we all want you
Me and the boys we all go through
You've got to learn to hold your tongue
This ain't the moon, this is burnin' sun
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the dye is cast
When the dye is cast and you have no choice
We will run with dirty boys

When we saw
Mishima's dog
Trapped between the rocks
Blocking the waterfall
The songs of dust
The world would end
The night was always falling
The peacock in the snow
And I tell myself
I don't know who I am
And I tell myself
I don't know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison
I can only love you
By hating him more
That's not the truth
It's too big a world
He believed
That love is theft
Love and whores
The theft of love
And I tell myself
I don't know who I am
And I tell myself
I don't know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison
But I am a seer
I am a liar
I am a seer
But I am a liar
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison

There‚Äôs a graveyard by the station
Where the girls wear nylon skirts and
Sandals from Hungary
The boys ride their Riga 1‚Äôs
Upon the little hill
Such sadness and grief
The trees die standing
That‚Äôs where we made our trysts
And struggled with our guns
Would you still love me
If the clocks could go backwards?
The girls would fill with blood and
The grass would be green again
Remember the dead
They were so great, some of them
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
How does the grass grow?
Blood, blood, blood
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
Where do the boys lie?
Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow?
Blood, blood, blood
But I lived a blind life
A white face in prison
But you made a life out of nothing
Now I ride my black horse
I miss you more
Than you‚Äôll ever, ever know
Waiting with my red eyes
And my stone heart
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
How does the grass grow?
Blood, blood, blood
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
Where do the boys lie?
Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow?
Blood, blood, blood
I gaze in defeat
At the stars in the night
The light in my life burnt away
There will be no tomorrow
Then you sigh in your sleep
And meaning returns with the day
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
Where do the boys lie?
Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow?
Blood, blood, blood

Nabokov is sun-licked now
Upon the beach at Grunewald
Brilliant and naked just
The way that authors look
Clare and Lady Manners drink
Until the other cows go home
Gossip till their lips are bleeding
Politics and all
I'd rather be high 
(I'd rather be high)
I'd rather be flying 
(I'd rather be flying)
I'd rather be dead or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
I'd rather be high
The Thames was black, the tower dark
I flew to Cairo, find my regiment
City's full of generals
And generals full of shit
I stumble to the graveyard and I
Lay down by my parents, whisper
Just remember duckies
Everybody gets got
I'd rather be high 
(I'd rather be high)
I'd rather be flying 
(I'd rather be flying)
I'd rather be dead or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
I'd rather be high
I'm seventeen, my looks can prove it
I'm so afraid that I will lose it
I'd rather smoke and phone my ex
Be pleading for some teenage sex, yeah
I'd rather be high 
(I'd rather be high)
I'd rather be flying 
(I'd rather be flying)
I'd rather be dead or out of my head
Than training these guns on the men in the sand
I'd rather be high
(I'd rather be flying)
I'd rather be high
(I'd rather be flying)
I'd rather be flying
I'd rather be high
I'd rather be flying

Oh, oh, oh
If you can see me, I can see you
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads, so take this knife
And meet me across the river
Just chutes and ladders and this is the kiss
American Anna, fantastic Alsatian
From nowhere to nothing
And I go way back
Children swarm like thousands of bugs
Towards the lights the beacons above the hill
The stars to the West, the South, the North
And to the East
Now you could say I've got a gift of sorts
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
A love of violence and dread of sighs
If you can see me, I can see you
If you can see me, I can see you
I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God
Swear to destroy the beasts, stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads, so take this knife
And meet me across the river
I will take your lands and all that lays beneath
The dust of cold flowers, prison of dark of ashes
I will slaughter your kind who descend from belief
I am the spirit of greed, a lord of theft
I'll burn all your books and the problems they make
If you can see me, I can see you
If you can see me

It's the darkest hour, you're twenty two
The voice of youth, the hour of dread
The darkest hour and your voice is new
Love is lost, lost is love
Your country's new, your friends are new
Your house and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new and your accent too
But your fear is as old as the world
Say goodbye to the thrills of life
Where love was good, no love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello, you're a beautiful girl
Say hello to the lunatic men
Tell them your secrets, they're like the grave
Oh, what have you done?
Oh, what have you done?
Love is lost, lost is love
You know so much, it's making you cry
You refuse to talk but you think like mad
You've cut out your soul and the face of thought
Oh, what have you done? 
Oh, what have you done?
Oh, what have you done? 
Oh, what have you done?

"Look into my eyes," he tells her.
"I'm gonna say goodbye," he says yeah
"Do not cry," she begs of him goodbye yeah
All that day she thinks of his love, yeah
They whip him through the streets and alleys there
The gormless and the baying crowd right there
They can't get enough of that doomsday song
They can't get enough of it all
Listen
"Listen to the whores," he tells her.
He fashions paper sculptures of them
Then drags them to the river‚Äòs bank in the cart
Their soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark
And the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin
Of his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day
Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases
They chase him through the alleys, chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest
First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with satan while they dress like the saints
They know God exists for the devil told them so
They scream my name aloud down into the well below
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day
Listen

Valentine told me who's to go
Feelings he's treasured most of all
The teachers and the football star
It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hand
Valentine told me so
He's got something to say
It's Valentine's Day
The rhythm of the crowd
Teddy and Judy down
Valentine sees it all
He's got something to say
It's Valentine's Day
Valentine told me how he'd feel
If all the world were under his heels
Or stumbling through the mall
It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hand
Valentine knows it all
He's got something to say
It's Valentine's Day
Valentine, Valentine
Valentine, Valentine
It's in his scrawny hand
It's in his icy heart
It's happening today
Valentine, Valentine
It's in his scrawny hand
It's in his icy heart
It's happening today
Valentine, Valentine

Had to get the train
From Potsdamer Platz
You never knew that
That I could do that
Just walking the dead
Sitting in the Dschungel
On N√ºrnberger Stra√üe
A man lost in time
Near KaDeWe
Just walking the dead
Where are we now? Where are we now?
The moment you know, you know, you know
Twenty thousand people
Cross B√∂sebr√ºcke
Fingers are crossed
Just in case
Walking the dead
Where are we now? Where are we now?
The moment you know, you know, you know
As long as there's sun
As long as there's sun
As long as there's rain
As long as there's rain
As long as there's fire
As long as there's fire
As long as there's me
As long as there's you

No one ever saw you 
Moving through the dark
Leaving slips of paper 
Somewhere in the park
Hidden from your friends
Stealing all they knew
Love is thrown in airless rooms
Then vile rewards for you
But I'm gonna tell
Yes, I've gotta tell
Gotta tell the things you've said
When you're talking in the dark
And I'm gonna tell the things you've done
When you're walking through the park
Some night on the thriller‚Äôs street
Will come a silent gun
You've got a dangerous heart
You stole their trust, their moon, their sun
There'll come assassin‚Äôs needle 
On a crowded train
I bet you'll feel so lonely 
You could die
Buildings crammed with people
Landscape filled with wrath
Grey concrete city
Rain has wet the street
I want to see you clearly 
Before you close the door
A room of bloody history
You made sure of that
I can see you as a corpse 
Hanging from a beam
I can read you like a book
I can feel you falling
I hear you moaning in your room
Oh, see if I care
Oh please, please make it soon
Walls have got you cornered
You've got the blues my friend
And people don't like you
But you will leave without a sound, without an end
Oblivion shall own you
Death alone shall love you
I hope you feel so lonely
You could die
(You feel so lonely )
You could die
You feel so lonely 
You could die

Midnight in the Village
Seeger lights the candles
From Bitter End to Gaslight
Baez leaves the stage
Ochs takes notes
When the black girl and guitar
Burn together hot in rage
You‚Äôve got what it takes
You say too much
You will set the world, babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene babe
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world, babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire
Kennedy would kill
For the lines that you‚Äôve written
Van Ronk says to Bobby
She‚Äôs the next real thing
Crouched in the half light
Screaming like a banshee
You‚Äôre in the boat, babe
We‚Äôre in the water
You say too much
You will set the world, babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene, babe
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world, babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire
You will set the world, babe
You will set the world on fire
Oh, I can work the scene, babe
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world, babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire
You will set the world, babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene, babe
Oh, I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world, babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire

Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people
And all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice cream parlour
Drinking milk shakes, cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years

Oh, she's a tongue twisting storm
Comes to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey, not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on the 'lectric dream
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
Then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're the Spiders From Mars
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
C'mon
Come on, come on
Really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating 'round 
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
Well, all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a hoochie koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants you can give her something too
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
Lady stardust sang songs
Of darkness and disgrace
And he was all right, the band was all together
Yes, he was all right, the song went on forever
Yes, he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long
Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady stardust sang songs
Of darkness and dismay
And he was all right, the band was all together
Yes, he was all right, his song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise
And he sang all night long
Oh, how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name
Oh there was all right, the band was all together
Yes, he was all right, and his song went on forever
He was awful nice
Really quite paradise
He sang all night long

I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man love is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Freak out
Far out
In out

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe, but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just turn on with me, and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands

Stone love, she kneels before the grave
A brave son, who gave his life to see the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love, a boy and girl are talking
New words, that only they can share in
New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in it's choosing, sweeping over 'cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving
Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love, and how my God on high is
All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him
Love is careless in it's choosing, sweeping over 'cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving

Hey my love
Goodbye love
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll, "Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound it seemed to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him, too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock 'n' roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star
Get it all, yeah
Ooh, yeah
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd come on like a regular superstar
I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star
Get it all, yeah
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd come on like a regular superstar
I could fall asleep at night as a rock 'n' roll star
I could fall in love all right as a rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star
Rock 'n' roll star

Hey man
Oh, leave me alone, you know
Hey man
Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man
I gotta straighten my face
This mellow-thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man
My schoolday's insane
Hey man
My work's down the drain
Hey man
Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Hey man
Oh Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man
I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man
D-droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Oh, hit me
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Oh, she's all right
My Suffragette City
My Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
Ooh, oh Suffragette City
Ooh, my Suffragette City
Ooh-how, my Suffragette City
Ooh-how, yea
Ah, wham bam thank you ma'am!
My Suffragette City
My Suffragette City - Quite alright
My Suffragette City - Too fine
My Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Suffragette!

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd Browning's freak you was.
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
Mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man go
Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed
Diamond Dogs are civilised
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh! Who!
Ooh ...
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Waf waf! Woof woof! Wah wah!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool!
Diamond Dogs rule
OK?
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah. oh
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah, oh

Let me put my arms around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh, babe, it'll be all right
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fallout saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
That stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Where once had raged a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday, yeah
Yeah
Drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
Drive, drive-in Saturday (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a drive-in Saturday, yeah (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
(It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame
(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(Get me some, fame)
(Now get-ah, fame)

(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
Don't let me hear you say life's
Taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come, get up, my baby)
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come, get up, my baby)
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car, twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon wish upon day upon day, I believe, oh, Lord
I believe all the way
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
I'll stick with you, baby, for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)

(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)

Well, Annie's pretty neat
She always eats her meat
And Joe is awful strong
Bet your life he's puttin' us on
Oh, lordy 
Oh, lordy
You know I need some lovin'
I'm movin'
Touch me
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing
Oh, shadow love was quick and lean
Life's a well-thumbed machine
I saw you watchin' from the stairs
You're everyone that ever cared
Oh, lordy
Oh, lordy
You know I need some lovin'
I'm movin'
Touch me
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing
Dancing
Won't someone touch me
Touch me
Ooh

I don't wanna lose, the good thing, that I've got
If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot
For your love, is better. than any love other I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock - on wood
Baby
I got superstitious, about you, but I can't take a chance
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock - on wood
Yeah!
It's no secret, but that woman, fills my lovin' cup
She seems, so ready, that I can't get enough
And her love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, it's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock - on wood
Baby!
Better, yes, better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Yes, I better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh, knock on wood
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) You know I would, would
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) It's no secret
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) No, oh, better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Above me
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) I can't leave her
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh no, baby
Knock on wood, WOO!

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
Uh
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe, but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just turn on with me, and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
You acted funny trying to spend my money
You're out there playing your high class games of sorrow
Sorrow
You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ah, ah, ah
I tried to find her 'cause I can't resist her
(I tried to find her 'cause I can't resist her)
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head
Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?

"Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
"Ground Control to Major Tom (10, 9, 8, 7, 6)
Commencing countdown, engines on (5, 4, 3, 2)
Check ignition and may God's love be with you (1, lift off)
"This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare"
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
"For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
"Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much" - "She knows.
"Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you..."
"Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do"

Hey my love
Goodbye love
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll, "Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound it seemed to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him, too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it

Hey man
Oh, leave me alone, you know
Hey man
Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man
I gotta straighten my face
This mellow-thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man
My schoolday's insane
Hey man
My work's down the drain
Hey man
Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Hey man
Oh Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man
I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man
D-droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket

My Suffragette City - Too fine
My Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Suffragette!

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

Up every evening 'bout a
Half eight or nine I give my
Complete attention to a
Very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a
He's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
I brought my baby home, she
She sat around forlorn
She saw my TVC one five
And baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my

So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way
Be with my baby, then
We'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five

They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All night)
But she wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture window (Doo doo doo doo)
She finds the slinky vagabond (Doo doo doo doo)
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak and his type, all for nothing (Doo doo doo doo)
Misses a step and cuts his hand, but (Doo doo doo doo)
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song, she cries
"Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yeah, ah-yeah
(She wants the young American)
All right
(All right)
Well, she wants the young American
All the way from Washington
Her breadwinner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?", well
(All night)
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yes, he does, ah
(He wants the young American)
Mmm mmm mmm
(All right) Well, all right
Well, he wants the young American
Do you remember your President Nixon? (Doo doo doo doo)
Do you remember the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American? (Doo doo doo doo)
Just you and your idol sing falsetto 'bout (Doo doo doo doo)
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor (Doo doo doo doo)
In case, just in case of depression? (Doo doo doo doo)
Sit on your hands on the bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro Sheeners
Ain't that close to love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, ain't that poster love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, it ain't that Barbie Doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and
(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American, young American)
Young American, ah
(You want the young American)
All right, ah
(All right)
You want the young American
You ain't a pimp, and you ain't a hustler
(Young American, young American)
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
(You want the young American)
(All night)
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh, boy)
I got a suite and-ah you got defeat
(All night)
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And ain't there a child I can hold without judging-ah?
(Young American, young American)
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
(All right)
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?
All night
I want the young American
(Young American, young American)
The young American
(I want the young American)
(All right)
All night, I want the young American, young American

I want what you want, I want what you want

You want what I, I want you, you want I, I want, you want

I want what you want, but you want what I want, you

You want I, I want you
And all I want is a young American-ah

A young American, a young American

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red 
Rich men's children running past 
Their fathers dressed in hose 
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes 
Gazing eyes and running wild 
Past the stocks and over stiles 
Kiss the window merry child 
But come and buy my toys 
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn 
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn 
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill 
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will 
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys 
Leave the parsley on the stalls 
Come and buy my toys 
You shall own a cambric shirt 
You shall work your father's land 
But now you shall play in the market square 
Till you'll be a man 
Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red

The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I'll watch them sink before your gaze
Senjorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love like a ragged soldier
Catching butterflies
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh I'm so much in love like the little boy
Who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?
In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

Fingertips sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut furs that hide behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in a tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor 
He's cloaked and clothed in saffran robes, his beads are all he owns
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man
Fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war, a gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been, I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin
Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder,
Because the years of threading daisies lie behind you now.
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told.
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and paints and beads.
I will show you games where the winner never wins.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key,
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals.
We shall drink the oldest wine, and velvet skies will linger.
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free.
I will hold a lighted lamp, and we shall walk together.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Your darkened eyes throw mystery,
But your lips are void of history.
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you?
I will give you dreams,
And I'll tell you things you'd like to hear.
Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.
Let me sleep beside you.

Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door, I'll wave my flag and shout
Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid, it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool
Oh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry
Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Well, I might be able to stretch it till Wednesday

Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand
Rubber Band
In 1910, I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh
Rubber Band
Won't you play your haunting theme again to me?
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
Oh, play that theme
Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in library parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love
Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh
spoken:
Oh sob, I hope you break your baton

La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 
Jack Frost took her hand and left me
Jack Frost ain't so cool 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away 
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday 
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
See my eyes, my window pane 
See my tears like gentle rain 
That's the memory of a summer day 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 
La la la la la la (repeat)

She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house.
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
And never took her out.
She wore a trench coat, khaki.
Her hobnail boots were full of holes.
She's got medals.
Her mother called her "Mary," but she changed her name to "Tommy,"
She's a one... oh.
She went and joined the army,
Passed the medical; don't ask me how it's done.
They sent her to the front line,
Fighting for her country's name.
She's got medals.
She got very tired of picking up girls,
Cleaning her gun, and shaving her curls.
Then the enemy dropped a bomb.
Survivors there were none.
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead.
She'd deserted on the previous morning.
Replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green.
Called herself Eileen.
Came to London town.
Now she's settled down.
She's got medals.

Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Potala lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly Boy Blue, blue
Silly Boy Blue
Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly Boy Blue, Blue
Silly Boy Blue
You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die
La la la la la, la la, la la la la

Child of Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man

Bow Bells strike another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away
Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you
Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys
You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys
A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, 'cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys

There is a happy land where only children live 
They don't have the time to learn the ways 
Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves 
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite 
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike 
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him 
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us 
Mother calls, but we don't hear 
There's lots more things to do 
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet 
But we will be, very shortly 
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry 
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky 
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away 
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray 
There is a happy land where only children live 
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup

Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 
Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum 
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days 
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me 
Riding on a golden horse 
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you 
Happy at the sound of your voice 
Maybe I'll slay a dragon for you 
Or banish wicked giants from the land 
But you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you 
We will only love each other as forever 
When I live my dream 
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 
And the empty man you left behind 
It's a broken heart that dreams
It's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream 
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 
Wish, and the storm will fade away 
Wish again, and you will stand before me
While the sky will paint an overture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream 
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me 
Let me be the one to understand 
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me 
Then we can live in our new land 
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream...

I've nothing much to offer
There's nothing much to take
I'm an absolute beginner
And I'm absolutely sane
As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films
There's no reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true
Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake
Oh we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches
Just like the films
If there's reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true

There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes
A kind of pale jewel
Open and closed
Within your eyes
I'll place the sky
Within your eyes
There's such a fooled heart
Beatin' so fast
In search of new dreams
A love that will last
Within your heart
I'll place the moon
Within your heart
As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill is gone
Wasn't too much fun at all
But I'll be there for you-ou-ou
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling down
Falling in love
I'll paint you mornings of gold
I'll spin you Valentine evenings
Though we're strangers 'til now
We're choosing the path
Between the stars
I'll leave my love
Between the stars
As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill is gone
Wasn't too much fun at all
But I'll be there for you-ou-ou
As the world falls down
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense to fall
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down

Blue Jean, I just met a girl named Blue Jean
Blue Jean, she got a camouflaged face and no money
Remember, they always let you down when you need 'em
Oh, Blue Jean, is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean?
She got a police bike
She got a turned up nose
Sometimes I feel like (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me (Oh, somebody send me)
One day, I'm gonna write a poem in a letter
One day, I'm gonna get that faculty together
Remember that everybody has to wait in line
For Blue Jean, look out world, you know I've got mine
She got Latin roots
She got everything
Sometimes I feel like (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Sometimes I feel like (Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean (Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody somebody (Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me (Oh, somebody send me)

Something's going on in society

You chew your fingers and stare at the floor

One wrong word and you're out of sync
Talking 'bout a hands on policy

Death to the trees

They weren't bad, they weren't brave
Nothing is embarrassing

There are too many people, too much belief

Where there's trouble there's poetry

Don't look down
They're making sorta crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down
'Cause they were making crazy sounds
From Central Park to shanty town
He always heard that crazy sound
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound
And I can't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I've always heard that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
Don't look down
Don't look, don't look down
No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound
I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down
Don't look down, no
Well, don't look, don't look down

If you should ever leave me
My life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what I'd be without you

I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stuborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting bout those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head
Keep forgetting you don't love me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head
Keep forgetting you don't love me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more

Watching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're traveling the holy land
Opening telegrams oh ho
Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind oh ho
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan
Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays oh ho
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail oh ho
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear oh ho
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
You pray till the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you'll believe you're loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
Believeing the strangest things (loving the alien)

Down where your paint is cracking
Look down you backstair buddy
Somebody's living there and
He don't really feel the weather
And he don't share your pleasures
No he don't share your pleasures
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash
Ah you can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
Somewhere a baby's bleeding
Somewhere a mother's needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger
You'll find him interesting
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he doesn't build for you
Everybody always wants to run with you
Ah you can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash
Ah you can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
On the neighborhood threat (a night in your face)
Don't place your bets (a night in your place)
On the neighborhood threat (will you still place your bets)
Don't place your bets (when the neighbor comes)
On the neighborhood threat (neighborhood threat)
Don't place yor bets
On the neighborhood threat

This is not America, sha la la la la
A little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die 
(This is not a miracle)
For this is not America
Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long 
(This is not America)
For this is not the miracle
There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea
For this is not America
Sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
This is not America, no
This is not, sha la la la la
Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals to the ground
(This could be the biggest sky)
So bloody red, tomorrow's clouds
A little piece of you
The little piece in me
Will die 
(This could be a miracle)
For this is not America
There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea
For this is not America
Sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
This is not America, no
This is not, sha la la la
This is not America, no
This is not
This is not America, no
This is not, sha la la la

Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
I am gonna love you till the end
I will love you till I reach the end
I will love you till I die
I will see you in the sky
Tonight

I've seen the city
I took the next flight
For Borneo
They say it's pretty
I like the t-shirts
In Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy
Or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo
Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in springtime
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter
I'll reply with a broken spear
That dusky mulatto
In nylons and tattoos
Hot juice in coke bottles
We dance in the sand
Well, they twirl and they tumble
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
I've been to Leon's
He's got nine daughters
And a stereo
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes down yonder in Borneo
Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle
They laugh and they mumble
Enjoying the show
And that dusky mulatto
Hot juice in coke bottles
In Blue Jeans and tattoos
Well, they twirl and they tumble
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
I like the free world
They say it's pretty
This time of year
They tumble and twirl
They tumble and twirl
I'll tumble and twirl
They twirl and they tumble
They twirl and they tumble
I like the free world
I like the free world
They say it's pretty
This time of year
This time of year
Tumble and tumble
I like the free world

Schau aus deinem Fenster
Schau wer draussen sitzt
Ich bin still hier wartend 
Schon die ganze Nacht
Wenn du dann dein Haus verl√§sst
Klingle ich und rufe
Ah, mein kleines M√§dchen
Mein brennend Verlangen erwachte Sonntag
Gib mir dein Herz und ich lieb' dich bis Dienstag
Who's that hiding in the apple tree
Clinging to a branch?
Don't be afraid, it's only me
Hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade
I'll keep you nice and cool
Ah, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never ending
And I'll love you till Tuesday
Let the wind blow through your hair
Be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon
Because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry
Ah, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame
I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl
And I'll love you till Tuesday
Lieb', lieb', lieb', lieb'
Lieb' dich bis Dienstag
Lieb', lieb', lieb', lieb'
Lieb' dich bis Dienstag
(Spoken:)  
Na ja, vielleicht wird's ja auch Mittwoch?

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me 
Riding on a golden horse 
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you 
Happy at the sound of your voice 
Maybe I'll slay a dragon for you 
Or banish wicked giants from the land 
But you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you 
We will only love each other as forever 
When I live my dream 
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 
And the empty man you left behind 
It's a broken heart that dreams
It's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream 
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 
Wish, and the storm will fade away 
Wish again, and you will stand before me
While the sky will paint an overture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream 
When I live my dream, please be there to meet me 
Let me be the one to understand 
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me 
Then we can live in our new land 
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream...

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd Browning's freak you was.
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
Mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man go
Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed
Diamond Dogs are civilised
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh! Who!
Ooh ...
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Waf waf! Woof woof! Wah wah!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool!
Diamond Dogs rule
OK?
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah. oh
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah, oh

Let me put my arms around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh, babe, it'll be all right
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fallout saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
That stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Where once had raged a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday, yeah
Yeah
Drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
Drive, drive-in Saturday (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a drive-in Saturday, yeah (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
(It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame
(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(Get me some, fame)

(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
Don't let me hear you say life's
Taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come, get up, my baby)
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come, get up, my baby)
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car, twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon wish upon day upon day, I believe, oh, Lord
I believe all the way
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
I'll stick with you, baby, for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold

Well, Annie's pretty neat
She always eats her meat
And Joe is awful strong
Bet your life he's puttin' us on
Oh, lordy 
Oh, lordy
You know I need some lovin'

Touch me
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on

You're everyone that ever cared

Dancing
Won't someone touch me
Touch me
Ooh

I don't wanna lose, the good thing, that I've got
If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot
For your love, is better. than any love other I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock - on wood
Baby
I got superstitious, about you, but I can't take a chance
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock - on wood
Yeah!
It's no secret, but that woman, fills my lovin' cup
She seems, so ready, that I can't get enough
And her love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, it's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock - on wood
Baby!
Better, yes, better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Yes, I better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh, knock on wood
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) You know I would, would
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) It's no secret
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) No, oh, better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Above me
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) I can't leave her
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh no, baby
Knock on wood, WOO!

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
Uh
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe, but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just turn on with me, and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
You acted funny trying to spend my money
You're out there playing your high class games of sorrow
Sorrow
You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ah, ah, ah
I tried to find her 'cause I can't resist her
(I tried to find her 'cause I can't resist her)
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head
Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?

"Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
"Ground Control to Major Tom (10, 9, 8, 7, 6)
Commencing countdown, engines on (5, 4, 3, 2)
Check ignition and may God's love be with you (1, lift off)
"This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare"
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
"For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
"Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much" - "She knows.
"Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you..."
"Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do"

Hey my love
Goodbye love
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll, "Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound it seemed to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him, too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Hey man
Oh, leave me alone, you know
Hey man
Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man
I gotta straighten my face
This mellow-thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man
My schoolday's insane
Hey man
My work's down the drain
Hey man
Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Hey man
Oh Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man
I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man
D-droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Oh, hit me
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Oh, she's all right
My Suffragette City
My Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
Ooh, oh Suffragette City
Ooh, my Suffragette City
Ooh-how, my Suffragette City
Ooh-how, yea
Ah, wham bam thank you ma'am!
My Suffragette City
My Suffragette City - Quite alright
My Suffragette City - Too fine
My Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Suffragette!

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All night)
But she wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture window (Doo doo doo doo)
She finds the slinky vagabond (Doo doo doo doo)
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak and his type, all for nothing (Doo doo doo doo)
Misses a step and cuts his hand, but (Doo doo doo doo)
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song, she cries
"Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yeah, ah-yeah
(She wants the young American)
All right
(All right)
Well, she wants the young American
All the way from Washington
Her breadwinner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?", well
(All night)
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yes, he does, ah
(He wants the young American)
Mmm mmm mmm
(All right) Well, all right
Well, he wants the young American
Do you remember your President Nixon? (Doo doo doo doo)
Do you remember the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American? (Doo doo doo doo)
Just you and your idol sing falsetto 'bout (Doo doo doo doo)
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor (Doo doo doo doo)
In case, just in case of depression? (Doo doo doo doo)
Sit on your hands on the bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro Sheeners
Ain't that close to love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, ain't that poster love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, it ain't that Barbie Doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and
(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American, young American)
Young American, ah
(You want the young American)
All right, ah
(All right)
You want the young American
You ain't a pimp, and you ain't a hustler
(Young American, young American)
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
(You want the young American)
(All night)
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh, boy)
I got a suite and-ah you got defeat
(All night)
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And ain't there a child I can hold without judging-ah?
(Young American, young American)
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
(All right)
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?
All night
I want the young American
(Young American, young American)
The young American
(I want the young American)
(All right)
All night, I want the young American, young American
(Young American, young American)
I want what you want, I want what you want
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want what I, I want you, you want I, I want, you want
(Young American, young American)
I want what you want, but you want what I want, you
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want I, I want you
And all I want is a young American-ah
(Young American, young American)
A young American, a young American
(I want the young American)

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

Weaving down a by-road
Singin' the song
That's my kind of high road
Gone wrong
My-my
Smile at least
You can't say no to
The Beauty and the Beast
Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong
But darling something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside here
Someone could get skinned
How?
My-my
Someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Darling
My-my
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Liebling
My-my
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should
My-my
Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank God Heaven left us
Standing on our feet
My-my
Beauty and the Beast
My-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to The Beauty and the Beast
Darling
My-my
My
My-my

Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife
Sometimes you get so lonely

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd Browning's freak you was.
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
Mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man go
Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed
Diamond Dogs are civilised
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh! Who!
Ooh ...
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Waf waf! Woof woof! Wah wah!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool!
Diamond Dogs rule
OK?
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah. oh
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah, oh

Let me put my arms around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh, babe, it'll be all right
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fallout saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
That stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Where once had raged a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday, yeah
Yeah
Drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
Drive, drive-in Saturday (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a drive-in Saturday, yeah (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
(It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame
(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame

Don't let me hear you say life's
Taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come, get up, my baby)
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come, get up, my baby)
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car, twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon wish upon day upon day, I believe, oh, Lord
I believe all the way
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
I'll stick with you, baby, for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)

Well, Annie's pretty neat
She always eats her meat
And Joe is awful strong
Bet your life he's puttin' us on
Oh, lordy 
Oh, lordy
You know I need some lovin'
I'm movin'
Touch me
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing
Oh, shadow love was quick and lean
Life's a well-thumbed machine
I saw you watchin' from the stairs
You're everyone that ever cared
Oh, lordy
Oh, lordy
You know I need some lovin'
I'm movin'
Touch me
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing
Dancing
Won't someone touch me
Touch me
Ooh

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

Wake up, you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
I look out my window, what do I see?
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we work here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain, you got to make way for the Homo superior
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain, you got to make way for the Homo superior

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?

Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?
You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
You acted funny trying to spend my money
You're out there playing your high class games of sorrow
Sorrow
You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ah, ah, ah
I tried to find her 'cause I can't resist her
(I tried to find her 'cause I can't resist her)
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head
Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?

"Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
"Ground Control to Major Tom (10, 9, 8, 7, 6)
Commencing countdown, engines on (5, 4, 3, 2)
Check ignition and may God's love be with you (1, lift off)
"This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare"
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
"For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
"Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much" - "She knows.
"Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you..."
"Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do"

Hey my love
Goodbye love
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll, "Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound it seemed to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him, too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me

Hey man
Oh, leave me alone, you know
Hey man
Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man
I gotta straighten my face
This mellow-thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man
My schoolday's insane
Hey man
My work's down the drain
Hey man
Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Hey man
Oh Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man
I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man
D-droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie)
 he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Go
Go, go

They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All night)
But she wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture window (Doo doo doo doo)
She finds the slinky vagabond (Doo doo doo doo)
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak and his type, all for nothing (Doo doo doo doo)
Misses a step and cuts his hand, but (Doo doo doo doo)
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song, she cries
"Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yeah, ah-yeah
(She wants the young American)
All right
(All right)
Well, she wants the young American
All the way from Washington
Her breadwinner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?", well
(All night)
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yes, he does, ah
(He wants the young American)
Mmm mmm mmm
(All right) Well, all right
Well, he wants the young American
Do you remember your President Nixon? (Doo doo doo doo)
Do you remember the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American? (Doo doo doo doo)
Just you and your idol sing falsetto 'bout (Doo doo doo doo)
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor (Doo doo doo doo)
In case, just in case of depression? (Doo doo doo doo)
Sit on your hands on the bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro Sheeners
Ain't that close to love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, ain't that poster love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, it ain't that Barbie Doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and
(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American, young American)
Young American, ah
(You want the young American)
All right, ah
(All right)
You want the young American
You ain't a pimp, and you ain't a hustler
(Young American, young American)
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
(You want the young American)
(All night)
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh, boy)
I got a suite and-ah you got defeat
(All night)
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And ain't there a child I can hold without judging-ah?
(Young American, young American)
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
(All right)
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?
All night
I want the young American

All night, I want the young American, young American

I want what you want, I want what you want

You want what I, I want you, you want I, I want, you want

I want what you want, but you want what I want, you

You want I, I want you
And all I want is a young American-ah

A young American, a young American

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

Question time
That says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
Mother says
That she can't stand the neighbours' talking
I've gotta pack my bags
Leave this home, start walking, yeah
I'm guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Remember when
We used to go to church on Sundays
I lay awake at night
Terrified of school on Mondays
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends always be found
And I can't
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Now I leave them all
In the Never-Never Land
The station seems so cold
The ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name,
"Hi Dave.
Drop in, see you around, come back
If you're this way again."
Oh, I'm on my own
I've got a long, long way to go
I hope I make it on my own
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing
I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China girl?
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down
I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
And I could pretend nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says, "shh"
She says
She says
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "shh"
She says
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh

Let me put my arms around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh, babe, it'll be all right
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fallout saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
That stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Where once had raged a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday, yeah
Yeah
Drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
Drive, drive-in Saturday (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a drive-in Saturday, yeah (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)
(It's a drive-in Saturday)
Yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)

It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

I forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we lay upon your bed
A city full of flowers
A city full of rain
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I don't regret anything at all
I remember how we wept
On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
The gods forgot they made me
So I forget them too
I listen to the shadows
I play among their graves
My heart was never broken
My patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Seven

All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same
Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Now that I've really got a chance
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Everything's falling into place
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Seeing my past to let it go
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's Child
(Oh, whoa)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was (x2)
Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and Lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet
Lucky old sun is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms
(Oh-neh don' go)
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Now that I've really got a chance
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Everything's falling into place
(Throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Seeing my past to let it go
(Yeah, throw me tomorrow... oh, oh)
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I

In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
I don't need another change, still you forced away into my scheme of things
You say we're growing, growing heart and soul
In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again, you're born once again for me
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in heaven or hell
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?
In this age of grand illusion you walked into my life out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Just as long as I can see, I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still flowing
Just as long as I can walk
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh...
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Oh lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away
Across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on 
Across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on
Across the universe
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing's gonna
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing's gonna
Noth, nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it
Hey yeah, Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change it
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change it (nothing's gonna change it)
Nothing's gonna change it (no no no no no)
Nothing's gonna change my world (nothing's gonna change my world)

Once we were lovers, can they understand?
Closer than others I was your, I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches, (oh), I remember them all
When I'm checking you out one day, to see if I'm
Faking it all
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me inside?
Show your love, love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

Sixty new cities, an' what do I
What do I find?

You know, it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame

Hey Jack, I better shake it off, put her out of my head
Thinking I balled just another young girl last night
Oh brother, I left a woman in that morning bed
Been on that trip so many times
Good God, was it really yesterday?
I've tried so many, many, many, many, many, many ways
I've lied and taken off into the day
Leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name, hit me Jack, 'cos I'm gonna love her way
Come back, my babe
Come back, my babe
Be holy again, i gave her
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby
That kind of love, can only destroy
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me
There was no rein to check me
When all of those little things walked on by
Oh, but I couldn't really stammer out a word
When that angel stuck in my mind
Looking for love won't hold me back
No, I'm gonna love her way
Come back, my babe
Come back, my babe
Be holy again, i gave her
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby
That kind of love, can only destroy
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me
Just playing that latest record
Waiting for the telephone to ring
Wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like they're pulling in the drive
No, no, no
I see her now a little tear running down her check
Lost, let down, people looking for me
I want to race down her street
And knock hard
Hard, hard on the door until
Until she breaks down into my arms like a
Treasured toy and I feel her pain
I'll be so strong, again and again
Come back my baby
I'm hold you again, I'll take you
I'll take you, baby, baby, baby
Baby, we're gonna have, ooh baby, baby, baby
My kind of love, can only bring you joy, I'm gonna
Yeah, baby, baby, yeah, I'll give you baby, baby, baby
'Cos it's gonna be me, it's gonna be me

He's everybody's token, on everybody's wall
Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall
He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
He says "I'm somebody"
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart
He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"
He's the savage son of the TV tube
Planets wrote the day was due
All the wisest men around
Predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he
Had the plan, he had to use
(Somebody) He's so divine (Oh oh) his soul shines

He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody)
Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young, that
Any man was judged by what he'd done
But now you pick them on the screen (what they look like)
Where they've been
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart
He says ("Don't hurry, baby) don't hurry baby
Somebody up there (somebody) please go (Oh oh)
Leaders come, and all the people knew
That given time the leaders go (Somebody somebody)
Tell me, can they hold you under the spell (Oh oh)
Can the ball game hold as well?
Does he smile like Valentino?
Could he sell you anything?
(Somebody somebody)
Keep your eyes on your soul,(Oh oh) keep your hand on your heart
(Don't hurry me baby)
Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"

Everybody's raised in blindness
Everbody knows it's true
Everybody feels that everything is real
Anybody's point of view
Nobody can break their bondage
Everyone can feel their chains
But even in my life, I knew you found your sight
And nothing would be quite the same
Please help me
Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell apart, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I be real?
Can I be real?
(Somebody real)
Hmm, if it's all a vast creation
Putting on a face that's new
Someone has to see, a role for him and me
Someone might as well be you
Up in heaven, any angel
Write a special game to play
Oh oh, could we, could we
Make a star to snatch their angels, boy?
Played your role for every day
Please help me
Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell apart, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I be real? Can I be?
Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell upon, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I be real? Can I be real?
Can I be real? Can I be?
(Who) Can I be? Yeah, yeah (now)
Yeah, can I be?
(Now)
You found me
(Now)
Can I be free?

(Hey, it ain't over)
Me, I hope that I'm crazy
I feel you driving and you're only the wheel
Slow down, let someone love you
Oh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
If there's nothing to hide me
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired
Somebody lied, but I say it's hip
To be alive
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(That's all ya gotta do)
(Ooh, it ain't over)
Me, I'm fresh on your pages
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(That's all ya gotta do)
(Ooh, it ain't over)
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(That's all ya gotta do, oh)
All you've got to do is win
(It ain't over)
When your smile is spreading thin
(Seek and believe in you)
Since you're trying not to lose
(It ain't over, no, no)
Since I'm not supposed to grin
(That's all ya gotta do)
All you've got to do is win
(It ain't over, no)
(Seek and believe in you)
All you've got to do is win
(It ain't over, no, no)
Wo-oh, all you've got
Is all you've got
(It ain't over)
It ain't over

They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All night)
But she wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture window (Doo doo doo doo)
She finds the slinky vagabond (Doo doo doo doo)
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak and his type, all for nothing (Doo doo doo doo)
Misses a step and cuts his hand, but (Doo doo doo doo)
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song, she cries
"Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yeah, ah-yeah
(She wants the young American)
All right
(All right)
Well, she wants the young American
All the way from Washington
Her breadwinner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?", well
(All night)
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yes, he does, ah
(He wants the young American)
Mmm mmm mmm
(All right) Well, all right
Well, he wants the young American
Do you remember your President Nixon? (Doo doo doo doo)
Do you remember the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American? (Doo doo doo doo)
Just you and your idol sing falsetto 'bout (Doo doo doo doo)
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor (Doo doo doo doo)
In case, just in case of depression? (Doo doo doo doo)
Sit on your hands on the bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro Sheeners
Ain't that close to love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, ain't that poster love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, it ain't that Barbie Doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and
(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American, young American)
Young American, ah
(You want the young American)
All right, ah
(All right)
You want the young American
You ain't a pimp, and you ain't a hustler
(Young American, young American)
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
(You want the young American)
(All night)
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh, boy)
I got a suite and-ah you got defeat
(All night)
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And ain't there a child I can hold without judging-ah?
(Young American, young American)
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
(All right)
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?
All night
I want the young American
(Young American, young American)
The young American
(I want the young American)
(All right)
All night, I want the young American, young American
(Young American, young American)
I want what you want, I want what you want
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want what I, I want you, you want I, I want, you want
(Young American, young American)
I want what you want, but you want what I want, you
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want I, I want you
And all I want is a young American-ah
(Young American, young American)
A young American, a young American
(I want the young American)
(All night)

All The Young Dudes
Ziggy rapped all night 'bout his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
All that speed child,
Who'd wanna stay alive
When you're 25?
Lucy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
And Freddy's got spots from ripping off the scars from his face?
Funky little boat race?
The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh man I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey brother you guessed
I'm a dude
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
Oh! You Pretty Things
Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
I look out my window and what do I see?
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, you pretty things (oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
Oh, you pretty things (oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Ooh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

I've seen all the rest of my Hollywood highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff from my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty, 'cause you just got paid
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel 
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head 
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
Please stay
You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since you pinned your baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions, a sack full of cheques
You made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
For a day
Oh yeah
Don't you care?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo!
Oh yeah

Oh, she's a tongue twisting storm
Comes to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey, not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on the 'lectric dream
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
Then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're the Spiders From Mars
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
C'mon
Come on, come on
Really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Well, don't you worry 'bout what's been on my mind
I'm in no hurry I can take my time
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tired
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm h-h-h-high
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together, now
I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
Well, I just can't apologise, no
Don't hang me up but don't let me down
We could have fun just by fooling around, and around and around
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together, now
Oh
You know I'm smiling baby
You need some guiding baby
I'm just deciding baby
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together, now
This doesn't happen to me every day
No excuses I've got anyway, hey
I'll satisfy your every need
And I'll know you'll satisfy me, oh my-my-my my-my
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
They said we were too young
Our kind of love was no fun
But our love comes from above
Do it!
Let's make love
Hoo!
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together, now

I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man love is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
Freak out
Far out
In out

My death waits like an old "rou√©"
So confident I'll go his way
Whistle to him and the passing time...
My death waits like a bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
We drank for that - and the passing time...
My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as our love is bright
Let's not think of that or the passing time...
But whatever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do...
Angel or devil, I don't care
For in front of that door... there is you.
My death waits like a beggar blind
Who sees the world through an unlit mind
Throw him a dime for the passing time...
My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
Let's not think about the passing time
My death waits there between your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Let's not think about the passing time...
But what ever lies behind the door,
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil I don't care
For in front of that door... There is you
My death waits there among the leaves
In magician's mysterious sleeves
Rabbits and dogs and the passing time...
My death waits there among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow cowers
Let's pick lilacs for the passing time...
My death waits there, in a double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
Let's not think about the passing time...
But whatever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil... I don't care
For in front of that door
There is... me

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe, but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just turn on with me, and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands

"Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
"Ground Control to Major Tom (10, 9, 8, 7, 6)
Commencing countdown, engines on (5, 4, 3, 2)
Check ignition and may God's love be with you (1, lift off)
"This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare"
"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
"For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
"Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much" - "She knows.

Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do"

Hey man
Oh, leave me alone, you know
Hey man
Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man
I gotta straighten my face
This mellow-thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man
My schoolday's insane
Hey man
My work's down the drain
Hey man
Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City

She's all right
Hey man
Oh Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man
I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man
D-droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know."
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too
So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around, go back!)
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)
Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Time, he's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy
Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy
Time, in Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think 
Oh God I'm still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed, your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, time!

Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old-fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so
Yeah! It was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! So it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking, the manholes were smoking
Every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played a Tiger Rag
And the villains on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! And I ran to the street, looking for information
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man

White light - White light gonna drive me out of my brain

Still feels right
What's that sound, what's that sound
Don't turn on, be dead or alive
No feeling
Here she comes
Oww, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) here she comes
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the wild eyed boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smoulders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh it's the madness in his eyes
As he breaks the night to cry:
It's really me
Really you
And really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you
And really me
You'll lose me though I'm always really free
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realise
Where the snow had saved a place
For the wild eyed boy from Freecloud
And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the wide-eyed boy from Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand
And the magic in the stare
Of the wild eyed boy said
Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face of the wise boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track

Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

Cash girls suffer me, I've got no enemies, I'm walking down
It's nothing to me
It's nothing to see
If I never see the English evergreens I'm running to
It's nothing to me
It's nothing to see
I'm dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I'm trying to
We bitches tear our magazines
Those oligarchs with foaming mouths phone
Now and then
Don't believe for just one second I'm forgetting you
I'm trying to
I'm dying to
Dollar days, survival sex, honour stretching tails to necks
I'm falling down
It's nothing to me
It's nothing to see
If I never see the English evergreens I'm running to
It's nothing to me
It's nothing to see
I'm dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I'm trying to
It's all gone wrong but on and on
The bitter nerve ends never end
I'm falling down
Don't believe for just one second I'm forgetting you
I'm trying to
I'm dying to
I'm trying to, I'm dying to
I'm trying to, I'm dying to
I'm trying to, I'm dying to
I'm trying to, I'm dying to

I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
With blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
That's the message that I sent
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
With blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

Look up here, I'm in heaven
I've got scars that can't be seen
I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now
Look up here, man, I'm in danger
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me
By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass
This way or no way
You know, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Now ain't that just like me
Oh, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Oh, I'll be free
Ain't that just like me

Sue, I got the job
We'll buy the house
You'll need to rest
But now we'll make it
Sue, the clinic called
The X-ray's fine
I brought you home
I just said home
Sue, you said you wanted writ
"Sue, The Virgin" on your stone
For your grave
Why too dark to speak the words
For I know that you have a son
Oh, folly, Sue
Ride the train, I'm far from home
In a season of crime, none need atone
I kissed your face
Sue, I pushed you down beneath the weeds
Endless faith in hopeless deeds
I kissed your face, I touched your face
Sue, goodbye
Sue, I found your note
That you wrote last night
It can't be right
You went with him
Sue, I never dreamed
I'm such a fool
Right from the start
You went with that clown

Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
'Tis a pity she was a whore
'Tis my curse, I suppose
That was patrol, that was patrol
This is the war
Black struck the kiss, she kept my cock
Smote the mistress, drifting on
'Tis a pity she was a whore
She stole my purse with rattling speed
That was patrol, this is the war
'Tis a pity she was a whore
'Tis a pity she was a whore
Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
'Tis a pity she was a whore
'Tis my fate, I suppose
That was patrol, that was patrol
'Tis a pity she was a whore
'Tis a pity she was cold
Wooh
Wooh
