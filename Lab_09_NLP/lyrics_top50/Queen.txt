[Verse 1]
I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango, just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be a Valentino, just for you

[Chorus]
"Ooh love, Ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight? Hey boy"
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy

[Verse 2]
Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat (Grow faster, faster)
Ooh, can you feel my love heat? (Ohh)
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command

[Chorus]
“Ooh love, Ooh lover boy
What’re you doing tonight? Hey boy”
Write my letter, feel much better
I’ll use my fancy patter on the telephone

[Bridge]
When I'm not with you
Think of you always
I miss you (I miss those long hot summer nights)
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
Love you, Love you
Hey boy where do you get it from?
Hey boy where did you go?
I learned my passion in the good old fashioned
School of lover boys

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 o'clock) precisely
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours, that will be fine (Come on and get it)

[Chorus]
"Ooh love (There he goes again)
Ooh lover boy (Who's my good old-fashioned lover boy? ooh ooh)
What're you doing tonight, hey boy"
Everything's all right, just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned (Fashioned) lover boy[Intro]
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

[Verse 1]
Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry)
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me (Yeah, yeah)
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I work hard (He works hard) every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (At the end of the day)
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own (Goes home, goes home on his own)
I get down (Down) on my knees (Knees)
And I start to pray (Praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Please)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Oh

[Bridge]
(He works hard) everyday (Everyday)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
No, I got no common sense
(He's got) I got nobody left to believe
No, no, no, no

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
(Oh, Lord)
Ooh somebody
Ooh (Somebody)
Anybody find me
Somebody to love
(Can anybody find me someone to love)

[Verse 3]
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (You just keep losing and losing)
I'm okay, I'm alright (He's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (Yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
(One day) Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord

[Outro]
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love

Oooh yeah

[Verse 1]
Get your party gown, get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating baby
Got my timing right, got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight, my little school babe
Your momma says you don't and your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
There is no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Oh, no

[Chorus 1]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors, I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight

[Verse 2]
"You're such a dirty louse, go get out of my house"
That's all I ever get from your
Your family ties, in fact, I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
But you know I don't give a light, I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart in hand to put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin' goin' on all night

[Chorus 2]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Send your little brother swimming with a brick, that's alright
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

[Guitar Solo]
Bad guy

[Verse 3]
Your mommy and your daddy are gonna plague me till I die
They can't understand it, I'm just a peace loving guy

[Chorus 3]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Get that big big big big big big daddy out the door
Tie your mother down, yeah, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight

[Outro]
Give me every inch of your love
All your love tonight, yeah
All your love

One race, one hope, one real decision
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-yeah, whoa-yeah, oh yeah!

[Bridge]
I had a dream when I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
But a cold wind blows and a dark rain falls
And in my heart, it shows
Look what they've done to my dream, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
One vision
So give me your hands, give me your hearts
I'm ready! There's only one direction
One world and one nation
Yeah, one vision

[Chorus]
No hate, no fight, just excitation
All through the night it's a celebration
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

[Interlude]

[Outro]
One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision
Give me one night, yeah

Just gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme fried chicken!
Vision...[Intro]
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic, no way

[Verse 1]
One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
It's a kind of magic
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic

[Pre-Chorus]
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Is this a kind of magic?
It's a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
[Verse 2]
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done
This is (This is) a kind (A kind) of magic
There can be only one, one, one, one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done, done

[Bridge]
Magic, it's a kind of magic

[Verse 1]
Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped and the children are created
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest
It's not easy, love, but you got friends you can trust

[Chorus]
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hands 'cause friends will be friends
Right till the end

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You try to track him down but somebody stole his number

[Pre-Chorus]
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way
It's so easy now 'cause you got friends you can trust

[Chorus]
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hands 'cause friends will be friends
Right 'til the end

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so easy now 'cause you got friends you can trust

There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us?

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh...

[Verse 2]
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh...

[Post-Chorus]
Who dares to love forever
Oh, when love must die?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?

[Outro]
Forever is our today
Who waits forever anyway?

[Instrumental outro][Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
In the year of '39 assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day and the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey, little darlin', wellaway
But my love, this cannot be
For so many years are gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Outro]
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand
For my life, still ahead, pity me[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
[Outro]
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
(Ahh)
You suck my blood like a leech, you break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts, you've taken all my money
And you want more
Misguided old mule with your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies who are fools
Of the first division

[Chorus 1]
Death on two legs, you're tearing me apart
Death on two legs, you never had a heart of your own
Kill joy, bad guy, big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me?, can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good, are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide? (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right? Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good? (Feel good)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot-air balloon
So no one gives you a damn, you're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide
A dog with disease, you're the king of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is Mr. Know All
Was the fin on your back part of the deal? Shark
[Chorus 2]
Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs, you never had a heart (You never did)
Of your own (Right from the start) Insane, should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed then make yourself null and void
Make me feel good (I feel good)[Verse]
The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the pistons a pumping
And the hubcaps all gleam

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When my hand's on your grease gun
Oh it's like a disease, son

[Chorus 1]
I'm in love with my car
Got to feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

[Bridge]
Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks saying this is the end now
Cars don't talk back, they're just four-wheeled friends, now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruising in overdrive
Don't have to listen to no run-of-the-mill talk jive

[Chorus 2]
I'm in love with my car (Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
Got to feel for my automobile (Ooh)
I'm in love with my car (Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
String back gloves in my automolove (Ooh)[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I go off to work on Monday morning
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for sunny-down
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday I go waltzing to the Zoo

[Bridge]
I come from London town, I'm just an ordinary guy
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre

[Verse 2]
I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night (there he goes again)
I'll be lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday afternoon

[Outro][Intro]

[Verse 1]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

[Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Verse 2]
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, and now desert me

[Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Bridge]
You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you (I still love you)
[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Back, hurry back, please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Outro]
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh[Instrumental intro]

[Intro]
Oh, oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man

[Verse 1]
I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves

[Pre-Chorus]
"I see no day," I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, people of the earth!
"Listen to the warning," the prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand

Ah, ah, children of the land
Quicken to the new life, take my hand
Fly and find the new green bough (Ooh)
Return like the white dove

[Verse 2]
He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late, all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own, his precious gain

[Pre-Chorus]
The earth will shake, in two will break
And death all round will be your dowry

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, people of the earth
"Listen to the warning," the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words (Oo-oo-oo-ooh)
Listen to the good plan

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And two by two, my human zoo
They'll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain
Oh, flee for your life
Who heed me not let all your treasure make you
Oh, fear for your life
Deceive you not, the fires of hell will take you (Hell will take you)
Should death await you

[Acapella Canon]
Ah, people can you hear me?
And now I know, and now I know
And now I know, I know, I know that you can hear me
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, the earth will shake, in two will break
The earth will shake, in two will break
Death all around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around
Now I know, now I know
Now I know
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
God give you grace to purge this place
And peace all around may be your fortune

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, children of the land
Love is still the answer, take my hand
The vision fades, a voice I hear
"Listen to the madman!"

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Ooh, but still I fear and still I dare not
Laugh at the madman![Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

[Chorus 1]
Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had
I've been with you such a long time, you're my sunshine
And I want you to know that my feelings are true
I really love you
(Ooh) Oh, you're my best friend

[Verse 2]
Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, I've been wandering 'round ('round)

Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

You know I'll never be lonely, you're my only one
And I love the things
I really love the things that you do
Oh, you're my best friend

[Chorus]
Flash! A-ah!

[Chorus]
Flash! A-ah!

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah

Oh, how I want to be free, baby
Oh, how I want to be free
Oh, how I want to break free

You're taking all the sunshine away
And making out like you're the main line, I knew that

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along with the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart, uh-huh
Feeling the beat of my heart

[Chorus]
Ooh, you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh, you're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Ooh, messing with the beat of my heart

[Bridge]
Ooh, you used to be a mean kid
Mm, making such a deal of life
Ooh, you were wishing and hoping and waiting
To really hit the big time
But did it happen, happen?
No, you're speeding too fast
Slow down, slow down, you'd better slow down
Slow down

[Verse 2]
You really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Feeling the beat of my heart
Can you feel it?
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah, yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart
Wooh-ooh
Feelin', feelin', feelin' it, honey
Feeling[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you - oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink, my dear
To be honest, you haven't got a clue

[Chorus]
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened - happened
It finally happened - ooh oh
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad
Oh dear

[Verse 2]
I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not at my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
[Chorus]
Oh dear, I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened uh huh
It finally happened I'm slightly mad - oh dear

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I'm knitting with only one needle
Unravelling fast, it's true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear, how about you?

[Chorus]
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened, oh yes
It finally happened

[Outro]
I'm slightly mad
Just very slightly mad
And there you have it[Instrumental Intro]
One, two, three, four
Ooh, ooh!

[Verse 1]
While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain

[Chorus]
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying, yeah
Just passing our time

[Verse 2]
Ooh, ooh!
While we live according to race, color or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on

[Chorus]
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
We'll tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying
'Till the end of time
'Till the end of time

[Bridge]
Through the sorrow, all through our splendor
Don't take offense at my innuendo

[Spanish Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego - be free, be free to yourself

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Ooh, ooh! (yeah!)
If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself, destroy our fears, release your mask

[Chorus]
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Hey! Tread that fine line
Yeah, we'll keep on smiling, yeah
And whatever will be, will be

[Outro]
We'll just keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time![Verse 1]
Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days, long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect - you know
The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shining - we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show

[Chorus 1]
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you

[Verse 2]
You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

[Chorus 2]
These are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find no change

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus 1]
Those were the days of our lives - yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find I still love you

[Outro]
I still love you[Verse 1]
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Verse 2]
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Bridge]
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

[Verse 3]
I'll top the bill
I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
Show must go on
Show must go on[Chorus]
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle

Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go 'round

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
Hey!

But I knew life before I left my nursery, huh
Left alone with big fat Fanny, she was such a naughty nanny
Hey, big woman, you made a bad boy out of me
Hey, hey
Woo!

[Verse 2]
I've been singing with my band, 'cross the water, 'cross the land
I've seen every blue eyed floozy on the way
But their beauty and their style went kinda smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time
Come on

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you

[Chorus]
(Don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball

If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
(Don't stop me now) 'Cause I'm having a good time
(Don't stop me now) Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode!

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh[Intro]

[Verse 1]
She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado 'bout nothing
Is what she'd try to say
So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day

[Chorus 1]
All dead, all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead and gone
All dead

[Chorus 2]
All dead, all dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead
Take me back again
You know my little friend's all dead and gone
[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child

[Chorus 3]
All dead, all dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe you're dead and gone

[Outro]
All dead and gone[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Outro]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end, oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions...[Verse 1]
Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singing

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

[Verse 2]
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday

Waving your banner all over the place

[Chorus]

We will, we will rock you

We will, we will rock you, everybody

We will, we will rock you, alright

[Guitar Solo][Verse 1]
Sammy was low, just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time, he'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him, "Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar"

[Chorus]
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

[Bridge]
He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself, he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay

[Verse 2]
Since he was small, had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time, he'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"
His boss said to him, "Now listen, boy! You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald Bar?"
[Chorus]
So honey, spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

[Outro]
Come on, honey, fly with menull[Instrumental intro]
Takeoff!

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you to be a superstar
But I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Yeah)
Keep yourself alive (Ooh)
It'll take you all your time and your money
But honey, you'll survive

[Verse 2]
Well I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on)
Keep yourself alive (Ooh)
It'll take you all your time and your money
Honey, you'll survive (Shake)

[Interlude]
Ow!

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Woah)
Keep yourself alive (Aww)
It'll take you all your time and your money
To keep me satisfied

[Bridge]
Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on)
Keep yourself alive
You take your time and take my money
Keep yourself alive

[Outro]
Keep yourself alive (Come on)
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive (Come on, come on)
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money, honey
You will survive
Keep you satisfied
Keep yourself alive[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I have sinned, dear Father
Father, I have sinned
Try and help me, Father
Won't you let me in?

[Chorus]
Liar!
Oh, nobody believes me
Liar!
Why don't you leave me alone?

[Verse 2]
Sire, I have stolen
Stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should

[Chorus]
Liar!
Oh, everybody deceives me
Liar!
Why don't you leave me alone?
[Bridge 1]
(Liar) I have sailed the seas
(Liar) From Mars to Mercury
(Liar) I have drunk the wine
(Liar) Time after time
(Liar) You're lying to me
(Liar) You're lying to me

Father please forgive me
You know you'll never leave me
Please will you direct me in the right way?
Liar, liar, liar, liar!
Liar!, that's what they keep calling me
Liar!, every day, every night
Liar, liar!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge 2]
(Listen) Are you going to listen?
Mama I'm gonna be your slave
All day long
Mama, I'm gonna try to behave
All day long
Mama, I'm gonna be your slave
All day long
I'm gonna serve you til' your dying day
All day long
I'm gonna keep you til' you dying day
All day long
I'm gonna kneel down by your side and pray
All day long
And pray
All day long

[Outro]
All day long, all day long, all day long
Liar, liar, they never ever let you win
Liar, liar, everything you do is sin
Liar, nobody believes you
Liar, they bring you down before you begin
Ooh, now let me tell you this
Now you know you could be dead before they let you...[Verse 1]
Fear me you Lords and
Lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers

[Chorus]
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye

[Verse 2]
Can you hear me you peers and privy counselors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust

[Chorus]
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye

[Bridge]
Sister— I live and lie for you
Mister— do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever (forever, forever)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Storm the master-marathon
I’ll fly through
By flash and thunder-fire and I'll survive (I'll survive, I'll survive)
Then I'll defy the laws of nature and come out alive
Then I'll get you
Be gone with you— you shod and, shady senators
Give out the good leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan and his troubadours

[Chorus]
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye

[Outro]
Oh I do like to be beside the seaside!
Oh I do like to be beside by the sea[Intro]
Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Why don't you mean it
Why do I follow you and where do you go

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it (And the world will so allow it)
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night
Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size

[Chorus]
(March to the Black Queen)

[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigga sugar then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise

[Chorus]
(Oooh march to the Black Queen)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey-chile, yes

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man and very soon
He'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love
[Verse 4]
I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power, now do the march of the Black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen
Ah ah ah ah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Walking true to style
She's vulgar, 'buse, and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes, and she never dots her "I's"

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone
La la la la forever, forever
Ah ah ah ah ah
[Segue to "Funny How Love Is"][Verse 1]
Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade

[Bridge]
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"

[Verse 2]
"Jenny will you stay, tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us
Tell me love, what do you say?"
"Oh no, I must away, to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday

[Bridge 2]
"It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell"

[Chorus]
Oh, Rock of Ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
Oh, Lady Moon, shine down a little people magic if you will

[Instrumental break 1:36-4:34]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase
Oh no I'm compromised, I must apologize
If my lady should discover how I spent my holidays[Verse 1]
It's so easy, but I can't do it
So risky - But I gotta chance it
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that's all you wanna talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

[Chorus]
It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo, wo, la la la, wo
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

[Verse 2]
No beginning, there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
Believe me, life goes on and on and on
Forgive me when I ask you where do I belong
You say "I - (You can do it)
Can't - (You can do it)
Set you free - (You can go and set him free)
From me"
But that's not true

[Chorus]
It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo, wo, la la la, wo
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

[Outro]
It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo, wo, la la la, wo
Wo, wo, la la
Wah wah ooh
But that's not true

It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo, wo, la la la, wo
Wo, wo, la la
Wah wah ooh
But I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods
Woah, woah, la-la-la, woah
Woah, woah, la-la
Wah wah ooh

It's in the lap of the Gods
Woah, woah, la-la-la, woah
Woah, woah, la-la
Wah wah ooh
But I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods
Woah, woah, la-la-la, woah
Woah, woah, la-la
Wah wah ooh

*Boom*[Intro]
Leave it in the lap of the Gods

[Verse]
I live my life for you
Think all my thoughts with you and only you
Anything you ask I do, for you
I touch your lips with mine
But in the end, I leave it to the lords
Leave it in the lap of the Gods, what more can I do?

[Chorus]
Leave it in the lap of the Gods (I leave it to you)
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods (I want you to)
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods

Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods

Lap of the Gods[Verse 1]
She keeps a Moët et Chandon in her pretty cabinet
Let them eat cake she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime an invitation, you can't decline (Ooh, ooh)
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (Pa-pa-pa-pa)
(Anytime)
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

[Verse 2]
To avoid complications, she never kept the same address
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah (Ooh, ooh)
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa)
Anytime

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Drop of a hat she's as willing as, playful as a pussy cat
(Ooh)
Then momentarily out of action (Ooh)
Temporarily out of gas (Ta-taaa)
To absolutely drive (Drive you wild, wild)
She's all out to get you

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam (Pa-pa-pa-ra)
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime)
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

[Outro]
Wanna try?[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going round, gotta clear out of town
Yeah, I'm smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the Law, gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, never, never get it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

[Chorus]
Crazy (stone cold crazy, you know)

[Verse 2]
Rainy afternoon I gotta blow a typhoon
And I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

[Chorus]
Crazy (stone cold crazy, you know)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet
With my rubber tommy water gun
Here come the deputy, he's gonna come and getta me
I gotta get me get up and run
They got the sirens loose, I ran right outta juice
They're going to put me in a cell, if I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell?

[Chorus]
Crazy (stone cold crazy, you know)

[Outro]
Ow![Intro]
Here I stand
Look around, around, around, around, around
But you won't see me
Now I'm here
Now I'm there
I'm just a
Just a new man
Yes, you made me live again

[Verse 1]
A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Ooh, don't worry, baby, I'm safe and sound

[Chorus 1]
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love her so?
Yeah, she made me live again
Yeah
[Verse 2]
A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

[Chorus 2]
Down in the city just Hoople and me
Don't I love him so?
Ooh, don't I love him so?

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Whatever comes of you and me
I'd love to leave my memory with you

[Verse 3]
Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around, around, around, around, around, around
Down in the city just as you and me
Don't I love you so
[Outro]
Go, go, go, little queenie![Intro]

[Chorus]
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Verse 1]
A-this thing (This thing) called love (Called love)
It cries (Like a baby) in a cradle all night
It swings (Woo, woo), it jives (Woo, woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish, woo, I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

[Bridge]
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

[Break]

[Verse 2]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike (Ah hum, ah hum)
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

[Outro]
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah[Intro]
Ooh, let's go!

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out
[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust


[Bridge]
Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust, hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh
Ooh

[Verse 3]
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah
[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust


[Outro]
Shoot out
Ay-yeah
Alright[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Open up your mind and let me step inside
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide

[Chorus]
It's so easy when you know the rules
It's so easy, all you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
Yeah

[Verse 2]
When you're feeling down and your resistance is low
Light another cigarette and let yourself go

[Chorus]
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world, all you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
Ooh yeah

[Bridge]
My game of love has just begun
Love runs from my head down to my toes
My love is pumping through my veins (play the game)
Driving me insane (come, come, come, come)
Come play the game, play the game, play the game
Play the game

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world (free world), all you have to do is fall in love

[Outro Chorus]
Play the game, yeah
Everybody play the game of love
Your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world (free world), all you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love[Verse 1]
It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, how I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham, it seems

[Pre-Chorus]
The years belie, we lived a lie
I love you 'til I die

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

[Verse 2]
The slate will soon be clean
I’ll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted, all that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
[Pre-Chorus]
I have no heart, I am cold inside
I have no real intent

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I'm naked and I'm far from home

[Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
Each night I cry, I still believe the lie
I love you 'til I die
Ow!

[Chorus/Outro]
Save me, save me, save me (Oh yeah!)
Yeah, save me, save me, ooh (Oh, save me)
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, save me, ooh
I'm naked and I'm far from home[Intro: Queen]
I want it all (Hey, yeah), I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger, can't see a way out

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
"It ain't much I'm asking," I heard him say
"Got to find me a future, move out of my way"

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
Listen, all you people, come gather 'round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People, do you hear me? Just give me the sign

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all (Give it all, I want it all)
I want it all, and I want it now (Hey)
I want it all, I want it all (Yes, I want it all, hey)
I want it all, and I want it now

[Bridge: Brian May (and Freddie Mercury)]
I'm a man with a one-track mind
So much to do in one lifetime (People, do you hear me?)
Not a man for compromise
And 'wheres' and 'whys' and living lies
So I'm living it all (Yes, I'm living it all)
And I'm giving it all (And I'm giving it all, ooh, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth
(Hear the cry, hear the cry of youth)

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all (Hey, yeah, yeah)
I want it all, and I want it now (Ooh, ooh)
I want it now

[Outro: Freddie Mercury]
I want it, I want it!
Oooh, huh![Intro]
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light yeah
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight, yeah

[Chorus 1]
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting for the hammer to fall, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, every night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Tow the line and play their game
Yeah, let the anesthetic cover it all
Until one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall
[Bridge]
Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same (Oh no, oh no)
Oh, lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no)
Baby, baby, now your struggle is all in vain

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

[Chorus 3]
What the hell are we fighting for?
Oh, just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you are waiting for the hammer to, hammer to fall

[Outro]
Hey, it's...
It's gonna fall
Hammer, you know
Yeah, hammer to fall
Woo!
Yeah, yeah
Woo, woo!
Yeah, yeah
While you're waiting for the hammer to fall, ooh
Give it to me one more time![Intro]
I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart

[Verse 1]
This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
You win, you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah, I fell in love
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each other's hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love
[Verse 2]
I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone

[Pre-Chorus]
How it hurts (Yeah) deep inside (Oh yeah)
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough - on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
I'm waiting for love

[Chorus]
It's a hard life
True lovers together
To love and live forever in each other's hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
It's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way
It's a long hard fight
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself and say I did it for love
[Outro]
Yes, I did it for love
For love
Oh, oh, oh I did it for love[Intro]
(Radio...)
(Radio...)

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

[Verse 2]
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made them laugh, you made them cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you
[Verse 3]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Someone still loves you!
[Bridge]
(Radio ga ga  Radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga  Radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga  Radio ga ga)

[Outro]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)
