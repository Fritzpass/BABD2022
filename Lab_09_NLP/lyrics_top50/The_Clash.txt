Stay around don't play around
This old town and all
Seems like I got to travel on

A lotta people won't get no supper tonight
A lotta people won't get no justice tonight
The battle is gettin' hotter
In this iration, Armagideon time

A lotta people runnin' and a'hidin' tonight
A lotta people won't get no justice tonight
Remember to kick it over
No one will guide you, Armagideon time

I (?)
They both are comin' through

(A lotta people ?)

Remember to kick it over
No one will guide you, Armagideon time
It's Armagideon
It's not Christmas time any more, Armagideon

A lotta people need...

(All right, time's up! Let's have you out of there!)
Ok, ok! Don't push us when we're hot!

A lotta people won't a'get no supper tonight
A lotta people sittin' down by the light
A lotta people won't a'get no supper tonight
A lotta people won't a'get no justice tonight
Remember to kick it over
No one will guide you, Armagideon time
Armagideon time[Chorus]
My daddy was a bank robber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to steal your money
[Verse 1]
Some is rich, and some is poor
That's the way the world is
But I don't believe in lyin' back
Sayin' how bad your luck is
So we came to jazz it up
We never loved a shovel
Break your back to earn our pay
An' don't forget to grovel

(Chorus)

The old man spoke up in a bar
Said "I never been in prison
A lifetime serving one machine
Is ten times worse than prison"
Imagine if all the boys in jail
Could get out now together
Whadd'ya think they'd want to say to us?
While we was bein' clever
Someday you'll meet your rockin' chair
'Cause that's where we're spinnin'
There's no point to wanna comb your hair
When it's grey and thinning
(Chorus)

So we came to jazz it up
We never loved a shovel
Break your back to earn our pay
An' don't forget to grovel

Hey

Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away

(Chorus)

Run rabbit run
Strike out boys, for the hills
I can find that hole in the wall
And I know that they never will

(Chorus)[Ginsberg]
Starved in metropolis
Hooked on necropolis
Addict of metropolis
Do the worm on the acropolis
Slamdance the cosmopolis
Enlighten the populace

[Verse 1: Strummer]
Hungry darkness of living
Who will thirst in the pit?
(Hooked in necropolis)
She spent a lifetime deciding
How to run from it
(Addicts of metropolis)
Once fate had a witness
And the years seemed like friends
(Girlfriends)
Now her child has a dream
But it begins like it ends

[Ginsberg]
Shot into eternity
Methadone kitty
Iron serenity

[Chorus]
Ghetto defendant
It is heroin pity
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city

(Strung out committee)
Walled out of the city
Clubbed down from uptown
Sprayed pest from the nest
Run out to barrio town
(The guards are itchy)
Forced to watch at the feast
Then sweep up the night
Flipped pieces of coin
(Broken bottles)
Exchanged for birthright

[Chorus]
Ghetto defendant it is heroin pity
(Strung out committee)
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city
(Not sitting pretty)
(Grafted in a jiffy)
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city

The ghetto prince of gutter poets
Was bounced out of the room
(Jean Arthur Rimbaud)
By the bodyguards of greed
For disturbing the tomb
(1873)
His words like flamethrowers
(Paris commune)
Burnt the ghettos in their chests
His face was painted whiter
And he was laid to rest
(Died in Marseille)

Ghetto defendant it is heroin pity
(Buried in Charleville)
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city
(Shut up in etenity)

[Ginsberg]
Guatemala

Can a poor worker do?

[Chorus]
[Ginsberg chanting][Intro]
This is a public service announcement..with guitar!

[Chorus]
Know your rights
All three of 'em:

[Verse 1]
Number 1
You have the right not to be killed
Murder is a crime
Unless it was done
By a Policeman
Or an aristocrat

[Chorus]
Oh, know your rights

[Verse 2]
And Number 2
You have the right to food money
Providing of course you
Don't mind a little
Investigation, humiliation
And if you cross your fingers
Rehabilitation

[Chorus]
These are your rights
Oh, know these rights

[Verse 3]
Number 3
You have the right to free speech
As long as you're not
Dumb enough to actually try it

[Chorus]
Know your rights
These are your rights
Oh, know your rights
These are your rights
All three of 'em, ha

[Outro]
It has been suggested
In some quarters that this is not enough
Well, get off the streets[Verse 1: Kosmo Vinyl]
I come from a long way away
And I know a fine thing when I see it
See it
For the same reason no one ever
Pointed a telescope at the sun
Talking about the Red Angels of N-Y City

[Hook: The Clash]
Who shot the shot?
Who got shot tonight?
Who shot the shot?
Who got shot tonight?

[Verse 2]
Not even five enforcement agencies can save their own
Never mind the people
Tonight it's raining on the Angels of the City
Did anyone prophesize these people?
Only Travis
Come in, Travis
"All the animals come out at night
Queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal
Some day a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets"

"Thank god for the rain to wash the trash off the sidewalk
Listen you screwheads
Here is a man who would not take it anymore
A man who stood up against the scum, the filth
Now I see clearly"
"Personally I know the alley
Where Jack feeds on the birds of night
Not even bubbies bicycling 2x2
Can stop the blood and feathers flying"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Wearing overalls and for once and for all
What is the dream?
I'll tell it
To live like they do in the movies
San Juan, you listening?

Yeah I bet you are
Hands up for Hollywood
(Hooray)
I hear you
Snappy on the air
Hang in there
Wall to wall
You saved the world
What else? You saved the girl
Champagne on ice
No stranger to Alcatraz
To boot
Or strip it down
Chop it a little
Being reasonable
Just freedom to move
To live
For women to take a walk in the park at midnight
Hey, but this is serious
She can't even get back home
Who shot the shot[Verse 1]
Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shaken to the top
The Sheikh he drove his Cadillac
He went a' cruisin' down the ville
The Muezzin was a'standing
On the radiator grille

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Verse 2]
By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric camel drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar pickin' thumb
As soon as the Shareef
Cleared the square
They began to wail

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Verse 3]
Now over at the temple
Oh! They really pack 'em in
The in crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
And the temple band took five
The crowd caught a whiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Verse 4]
The king called up his jet fighters
He said "You better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way"
As soon as the Shareef was
Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare
As soon as the Shareef was
Out of their hair
The jet pilots wailed

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

[Outro]
(Shareef don't like it)
Thinks it’s not kosher
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
Fundamentally can’t take it
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
You know he really hates it
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
Really, really hates it[Intro]
Oh! Hola!

[Verse 1]
Darling, you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here 'till the end of time
So you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

[Verse 2]
It's always tease, tease, tease
You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day it's fine and next it's black
So if you want me off your back
Well, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

[Chorus]
Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go, there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So come on and let me know

[Verse 3]
This indecision's bugging me (Esta indecisión me molesta)
If you don't want me, set me free (Si no me quieres, librarme)
Exactly whom I'm supposed to be (Dígame que tengo ser)
Don't you know which clothes even fit me? (Sabes que ropa me "quedrá"?)
Come on and let me know (Me tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow? (Me debo ir o quedarme?)
Split

[Chorus]
Should I stay or should I go now? (Yo me enfrío o lo soplo)
Should I stay or should I go now? (Yo me enfrío o lo soplo)
If I go there will be trouble (Si me voy va a haber peligro)
And if I stay it will be double (Si me quedo sera el doble)
So ya gotta let me know (Me tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow? (Tengo frío por los ojos)
Should I stay or should I go now? (Tengo frío por los ojos)
If I go there will be trouble (Si me voy va haber peligro)
And if I stay it wil be double (Si me quedo será el doble)
So ya gotta let me know (Me tienes que decir)
Should I stay or should I go?[Verse 1]
If you can play on fiddle
How's about a British jig and reel?
Speaking King's English in quotation
As railhead towns feel the steel mills rust
Water froze in the generation
Clear as winter ice
This is your paradise

There ain't no need for ya
There ain't no need for ya
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys

[Verse 2]
Wanna join in a chorus
Of the Amerasian blues?
When it's Christmas out in Ho Chi Minh City
Kiddie say papa papa papa papa papa-san take me home
See me got photo photo
Photograph of you
And Mamma Mamma Mamma-san
Of you and Mamma Mamma Mamma-san
Let me tell you 'bout your blood bamboo kid
It ain't Coca-Cola, it's rice
Straight to hell, boy
Go straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys

Oh Papa-san
Please take me home
Oh Papa-san
Everybody they wanna go home
So Mamma-san says

You wanna play mind-crazed banjo
On the druggy-drag ragtime U.S.A.?
In Parkland International
Ha, Junkiedom U.S.A
Where procaine proves the purest rock man groove
And rat poison
The volatile Molotov says

Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah
Straight to hell

[Verse 3]
Can you cough it up loud and strong
The immigrants
They wanna sing all night long
It could be anywhere
Most likely could be any frontier
Any hemisphere
No man's land
There ain't no asylum here
King Solomon he never lived 'round here
Straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys
Oh Pappa-san, please take me home
Everybody they wanna go home now[Spoken intro]
Four for a pound your face flannels, three for a pound your tea towels!
Four for a pound your face flannels, three for a pound your tea towels!

[Verse 1]
I hear a gang fight on a human factory farm
Are they howling out, or doing somebody harm?
On a catwalk jungle, somebody grabbed my arm
A voice spoke so cold it matched the weapon in her palm

[Chorus]
This is England
This knife of Sheffield steel
This is England
This is how we feel

[Verse 2]
Time on his hands the freezing mohawk strolls
He won't go for the carrots
Been beaten by the pole
Some sunny day confronted by his soul
His eye will see how fast you can grow old

[Chorus]
This is England
That I'm supposed to die for
This is England
Never gonna cry no more
[Verse 3]
Black shadow of the Vincent
Falls on a Triumph line
I got my motorcycle jacket
But I'm walking all the time
South Atlantic wind blows
Ice from a dying creed
I see no glory
And when will we get free?

[Chorus]
This is England
We can chain you to the rail
This is England
We can kill you in a jail

[Verse 4]
Hey, British boots go kick Bengali in the head
Police sit watching
The newspapers being read
All deaf to protests
And after the attacker fled
Out came the batons and
The biggest one then said

[Outro]
This is England
The land of illegal dances
This is England
Land of one thousand stances
This is England
This knife of Sheffield steel
This is England
This is how we feel
This is England
This is England[Chorus]
Well, I just got back an I wish I never leave now
(Where'd ya' go?)
Who that Martian arrival at the airport, yeah?
(Where'd ya' go?)
How many local dollars for a local anesthetic?
(Where'd ya' go?)
The Johnny on the corner wasn't very sympathetic
(Where'd ya' go?)

[Verse 1]
I went to the place where every white face
Is an invitation to robbery
An' sitting here in my safe European home
Don't wanna go back there again

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't I lucky, wouldn't it be lovely?
(Where'd ya' go?)
Send us all cards and have a lay in on Sunday

Well, I just got back an I wish I never leave now

(Where'd ya' go?)
How many local dollars for a local anesthetic?
(Where'd ya' go?)
The Johnny on the corner wasn't very sympathetic
(Where'd ya' go?)

[Verse 2]
They got the sun and they got the palm trees
(Where'd ya' go?)
They got the weed and they got the taxis
(Where'd ya' go?)
Whoa, "The Harder They Come" and the home of ol' Bluebeat
(Where'd ya' go?)
I'd stay and be a tourist but I can't take the gun play
(Where'd ya'?)

[Chorus]
Well, I just got back an I wish I never leave now
(Where'd ya' go?)
Who that Martian arrival at the airport, yeah?
(Where'd ya' go?)
How many local dollars for a local anesthetic?
(Where'd ya' go?)
The Johnny on the corner wasn't very sympathetic
(Where'd ya' go?)

We met when we were at school
Never took no shit from no one, we weren't fools
The teacher says we're dumb, we're only havin' fun
You know we piss on everyone in the classroom

[Verse 1]
When we got thrown out I left without much fuss
And weekends we'd go dancin' down Streatham on the bus
You always made me laugh, got me in bad fights
Play me pool all night, smokin' menthols

[Verse 2]
I practiced daily in my room
You were down at Crown plannin' your next move
Go on a nickin' spree, hit the wrong guy
Each of you get three years in Brixton

[Bridge]
I did my very best to write
How was Butlins? Were the screws too tight?
When you lot get out were gonna hit the town
We'll burn it fucking down to a cinder

[Chorus]
'Cause years have passed and things have changed
And I move anyway I want to go
And I'll never forget the feelin' I got
When I heard that you'd got home

[Outro]
And I'll never forget the smile on my face
'Cause I knew where you would be
And if you're in the Crown tonight have a drink on me
But go easy
Step lightly, yeah
Stay freeTommy gun
You ain't happy less you got one
Tommy gun
Ain't gonna shoot the place up
Just for fun
Maybe he want to die for the money
Maybe he wants to kill for his country
Whatever he wants, he's gonna get it

Tommy gun
You better strip it down for a customs run
Tommy gun
Waitin' at the airport 'til kingdom come
An' we can watch him make it
On the nine o'clock news
Standin' there in Palestine lightin' the fuse
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it

Tommy gun
Tommy gun

Tommy gun
A'you'll be dead when  war is won
Tommy gun
But did you have to gun down everyone?
I can see it's kill or be killed
A nation of destiny has gotta be fulfilled
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it
Tommy gun
A'you can be a hero in an age of none
Tommy gun
I'm cuttin' out your picture from page one
I'm gonna get a jacket just like yours
An' give my false support to your cause
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it
Alright

Okay, so let's agree about the price
And make it one jet airliner for ten prisoners
Boats an' tanks and planes, it's your game
Kings an' queens an' generals learn your name
I see all the innocent, the human sacrifice
And if death comes so cheap
Then the same goes for life[Verse 1]
When Johnny comes marchin' home again, hurrah, tala
He's comin' by bus or underground, hurrah, tala
A woman's eye will shed a tear
To see his face so beaten in fear
And it was just around the corner in the English Civil War

[Verse 2]
It was still at the stage of clubs and fists, hurrah, tala
When that well known face got beaten to bits, hurrah, tala
Your face was blue in the light of the screen
As watched the speech of an animal scream
New Party army was marchin' right over our heads

[Bridge]
All right!

[Pre-Chorus]
Ha, ha, I told you so, hurrah, tala
Says everybody that we know, hurrah, tala
But who hid a radio under the stairs?
Who got caught out unawares?
New Party army came marchin' right up the stairs

[Chorus]
When Johnny comes marchin' home again, hurrah, tala
Nobody understands it can happen again, hurrah, tala
The sun is shinin' and the kids are shoutin' loud
Ya' got to know it's shinin' through a crack in the cloud
And the shadows keep on fallin', when Johnny comes marchin' home
[Outro]
Hurrah, Johnny
Oh yeah, Johnny
Oh, the guns come home
(?) comin' home[Intro]
Driiiiiiiive!!!
Driiiiiiiive!!!

[Chorus]
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
Yes, she did
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
She said, "Hey, come here, Daddy!"
"I ain't never comin' back!"

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?
C'mon, sugar, just come on back to me
She said, "Balls to you, Big Daddy"

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?
Oh, c'mon, just hear my plea
She said, "Balls to you, Daddy"
She ain't comin' back to me

[Chorus]
Baby, baby drove up in a Cadillac
I said, "Jesus Christ! Where'd ya' get that Cadillac?"
She said, "Balls to you, Daddy"
She ain't never coming back! (x4)[Verse 1]
(The kingdom is ransacked
The jewels all taken back
And the chopper descends
They're hidden in the back
With a message on a half-baked tape
And the spool goes 'round
Sayin' I'm back here in this place
And I could cry
And there's smoke you could click on)

[Chorus]
A'what are we gonna do now?
Takin' off his turban, they said, "Is this man a Jew?"
Workin' for the clampdown
They put up a poster sayin' "We earn more than you!"
We're workin' for the clampdown
We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue-eyed men
To be young believers

[Post-Chorus]
The judge said "Five to ten" but I say "Double that again"
I'm not (workin' for the clampdown)
No man born with a livin' soul
Can be (workin' for the clampdown)
Kick over the wall, cause government's to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
D'you know that you can use it?

[Verse 2]
The voices in your head are callin'
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing comin'
Only a fool would think someone could save you
The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothin', so boy get running
It's the best years of your life they want to steal

[Chorus]
But, you grow up and you calm down
And you're (workin' for the clampdown)
You start wearin' blue and brown
And (workin' for the clampdown)
So you got someone to boss around
It makes ya' feel big now
You drift until you brutalize
Make your first kill now

[Post-Chorus]
In these days of evil presidentes
(Workin' for the clampdown)
But lately one or two has fully paid their due
For (workin' for the clampdown)
Ha! Get along! Get along!
(Workin' for the clampdown)
Ha! Get along! Get along!
(Workin' for the clampdown)

[Bridge]
Yeah I’m workin' hard in Harrisburg
Workin' hard in Petersburg
(Workin' for the clampdown)
(Workin' for the clampdown)
Ha! Get along! Get along
Beggin' to be melted down
(Get along, get along)
Work
Work
And I give away no secrets – ha!
Work
More work
More work
Work

[Outro]
Who's barmy now ?[Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world
And ends up makin' payments on a sofa or a girl
"Love" and "hate" tattooed across the knuckles of his hands
Hands that slap his kids around 'cause they don't understand how

[Chorus]
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story

[Verse 2]
In every gimmick hungry yob diggin' gold from rock 'n' roll
Grabs the mic and tell us he'll die before he's sold
But I believe in this and it's been tested by research
He who fucks nuns will later join the church

[Chorus]
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story

[Verse 3]
Fear in the gun sights
They say "Lie low"
You say "Ok"
Don't wanna play a show
No other thinking
Was it death or glory now?
Playin' the blues of kings
Sure looks better now
[Chorus]
Death or glory just another story
Death or glory just another story

[Verse 4]
In every dingy basement on every dingy street
Every draggin' handclap over every draggin' beat
That's just the beat of time, beat that must go on
If you've been tryin' for years we already heard your song

[Chorus]
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story

[Bridge]
Gotta march a long way
Fight a long time
Get to travel over mountains
Got to travel over seas
We gonna fight your brother
We gonna fight 'til you lose
We gonna raise trouble
We gonna raise hell
We gonna fight your brother
Raise hell
[Chorus]
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story1,2, a 1,2,3,4

Well they were given the grapes that go ripe in the sun
That loosen the screws at the back of the tongue
They told no one where they had begun
Four horsemen

They were given all the foods of vanity
And all the instant promises of immortality
But they bit the dust screamin' "Insanity!"
Four horsemen

One was over the edge, one was over the cliff
One was lickin' 'em dry with a bloody great spliff
When they picked up the hiker didn't want the lift
From the horsemen

But you, you're not searching, are you, now?
You're not lookin' anyhow
You're never gonna ride that lonely mile
Or put yourself up on trial
Oh, you told me how your life was so bad
And I agree that it does seem sad
But that's the price that you gotta pay
For lazin' all around all day
Four horsemen an' they comin' right through
Four horsemen and they're pissing by you
They make you look like you're wearing a truss
Four horsemen and it's gonna be us
Well they gave us everything for bendin' the mind
And we cleaned out their pockets and we drank 'em blind
It's a long way to the finish so don't get left behind
By those horsemen

And they gave us the grapes that went ripe in the sun
That loosen the screws at the back of the tongue
But we still told nothing 'bout what was to come
Four horsemen

We play all your rock and roll
We know your rockin' soul
We reach the parts other combos cannot reach
We reach the beaches other armies cannot reach
We've reached the top of the mountain they cannot reach
We play all your rock and roll
We know your rockin' soul
We play your rock and roll
We know your rockin' soul[Verse 1]
Well, I got a friend who's a man (who's a man)
What man?
The man who keeps me from the lonely, the only
He gives me what I need (what you need?)
What you got?
I need it all so badly

[Chorus]
Oh, anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want he gives it but not for free
It's hateful
And it's paid for
And I'm so grateful to be nowhere

[Verse 2]
This year I've lost some friends (some friends)
What friends?
I dunno, I didn't even notice
You see, I gotta go out again (again)
My friend
I gotta see that main man

[Chorus]
Oh, anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want he gives it but not for free
It's hateful
And it's paid for
And I'm so grateful to be nowhere
[Verse 3]
I killed all my nerves (my nerves)
What swerves?
I can't drive so steady
And already
I've lost my memory (my mind)
Behind
I can't see so clearly

[Chorus]
Oh, anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want he gives it but not for free
Oh, anything I want he gives it to me (Anything I want he gives it to me)
Anything I want he gives it, but not for free (Anything I want he gives it to me)
Anything I want, anything I wantIf it's true a rich man leads a sad life
That's what say from day to day
Then what do all the poor do with their lives
On judgment day, when nothin' is saved?

I've been beat up, I've been thrown out
But I'm not down, no I'm not down
I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, no I'm not down

On my own I faced a gang of jeering
In strange streets, oh
When my nerves were pumping and I fought my fear in
I didn't run, I was not done

I've been beat up, I've been thrown out
But I'm not down, no I'm not down
I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, no I'm not down

'Cause I've lived that kind of day
When none of your sorrows will go away
It goes down and down and hit the floor
Down and down and down some more
Depression
But I know there'll be some way
When I can swing everything back my way
Like skyscrapers rising up
Floor by floor, giving up
So you rock around and think that you're the toughest
In the world, the whole wide world
But you're streets away from where it gets the roughest
You ain't been there

I've been beat up, I've been thrown out
But I'm not down, no I'm not down
I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, no I'm not down

I'm not down
No, I'm not down
No, I'm not down
No, I'm not down
No, I'm not down
No, I'm not down
No, I'm not down

I'm not down[Intro]

Police walked in for Jimmy Jazz
I said "He ain't here, but he sure went by"
Oh, you're lookin' for Jimmy Jazz

Satta Massagana for Jimmy Dread
Cut off his ears and chop off his head
Police come look for Jimmy Jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz

So if you're gonna take a message 'cross the town
Maybe put it down somewhere over the other side
See it gets to Jimmy Jazz

[instrumental break]

So tell me now..!
The police came in they said "Now where's Jimmy Jazz?"
I said, "Hmm, he was here but, um, he said he went out"
Who you're lookin' for? Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz

Satta Massagana for Jimmy Dread
Cut off his ears and they'll chop off his head
Oh you're lookin' for Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz

What a relief!
I feel like a soldier
Look like a thief!
It's for the Jazz
Police a come a lookin' for the Jimmy Jazz
He came in and he went past
Oh, you're lookin' for the Jimmy Jazz

In fact, don't you bother me, not anymore
I can't take this tale, oh, no more
It's all around, Jimmy Jazz, Jazz

J-a-zee zee J-a-zed zed
J-a-zee zee J-a-zed zed
J-a-zed zed Jimmy Jazz
And then it sucks, he said, "Suck that!"
So go look all around, you can try your luck, brother
And see what ya' found
But I guarantee you that it ain't your day, your day
It ain't your day
Chop! Chop!Elevator! Goin' up!
In the gleamin' corridor of the 51st floor
The money can be made if you really want some more
Executive decision, at clinical precision
Jumping from the windows, filled with indecision

I get good advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice, party girl
Koke adds life where there isn't any
So freeze, man, freeze

It's the pause that refreshes in the corridors of power
When top men need a top up long before the happy hour
Your snakeskin suit and your alligator boot
You don't need a launderette, you can take 'em to the vet!

(Chorus)

Koka Kola advertising and cocaine
Strolling down the Broadway in the rain
Neon light sign says it
I read it in the paper, they're crazy
Suit your life, maybe so
In the White House, I know
All Over Berlin, they do it for years
And in Manhattan
Comin' through the door is a snub nose forty four
The barrel can't snort, it can spatter on the floor
Your eyeballs feel like pinballs
And your tongue feels like a fish
You're leapin' from the windows sayin'
"Don't give me none of this!"

(Chorus)

Hit the deck![Verse 1]
London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come outta' the cupboard, ya' boys and girls
London calling, now don't look to us
Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing

[Chorus]
The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growin' thin
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
Cause London is drownin', I, live by the river

[Verse 2]
(London calling) to the imitation zone
Forget it, brother, you can go it alone
London calling to the zombies of death
Quit holdin' out and draw another breath
London calling and I don't want to shout
But while we were talking I saw you noddin' out
London calling, see we ain't got no high
'Cept for that one with the yellowy eyes
[Chorus]
The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growin' thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Cause London is drowning, I, I live by the river

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growin' thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Cause London is drowning, I, I live by the river

[Bridge]
Now get this

[Verse 3]
(London calling), yes, I was there, too
And ya' know what they said? Well, some of it was true!
(London calling) at the top of the dial
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
(London calling)

[Outro]
I never felt so much alike alike alike[Chorus]
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

[Verse 1]
I wasn't born, so much as I fell out
Nobody seemed to notice me
We had a hedge back home in the suburbs
Over which I never could see
I heard the people who live on the ceiling
Scream and fight, most scarily
Hearing that noise was my first ever feelin'
That's how it's been, all around me

[Chorus]
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

[Verse 2]
I'm all tuned in, I see all the programs
I save coupons from packets of tea
I've got my giant hit, discotheque album
I empty a bottle, I feel a bit free
The kids in halls and the pipes in the walls
Making noises for company
Long distance callers make long distance calls
And the silence makes me lonely

[Chorus]
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

[Bridge]
And it's not here
It disappeared

[Chorus]
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

[Bridge]
I'm all lost

[Chorus]
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality(2,3,4)

Yeah, you must treat your lover girl right

That the blood must run 'round the block?

While cart of food goes rolling by

Spanish songs in Andalucía
The shooting sites in the days of '39
Oh, please, leave the ventana open
Federico Lorca is dead and gone
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls
The black cars of the Guardia Civil
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
I'm flyin' in on a DC 10 tonight

[Chorus]
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh, mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazón

[Verse 2]
Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died upon the hill
They sang the red flag
They wore the black one
After they died it was Mockingbird Hill
Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My señorita's rose was nipped in the bud

[Chorus]
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh, mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazón

[Verse 3]
The hillsides ring with "Free the people"
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39?
With trenches full of poets
The ragged army, fixin' bayonets to fight the other line
Spanish bombs rock the province
I'm hearin' music from another time
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava
I'm flyin' in on a DC 10 tonight

[Chorus]
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh, mi corazón

[Outro]
Spanish songs in Andalucía, Mandolina, (oh, mi corazón)
Spanish songs in Granada, oh, mi corazón (oh mi corazón)
(oh mi corazón)
(oh mi corazón)[Chorus]
There's a solitary man cryin', "Hold me"
It's only because he's a'lonely
And if the keeper of time runs slowly
He won't be alive for long!

If he only had time to tell of all of the things he planned
With a card up his sleeve, what would he achieve?
It means nothin'

To the opium dens and the barroom gin
In the Belmont chair playing violin
The gambler's face cracks into a grin
As he lays down the king of spades

But the dealer just stares
"There's something wrong here", he thinks
The gambler is seized and forced to his knees
And shot dead

He only wanted more time
Away from the darkest door
But his luck it gave in
As the dawn light crept in
And he lay on the floor

From the Hundred Year War to the Crimea
With a lance and a musket and a Roman spear
To all of the men who have stood with no fear
In the service of the King

Before you met your fate be sure you
Did not forsake
Your lover
May not be around anymore

(Repeat 1st verse)[Verse 1]
When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun
When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shot down on the pavement
Or waiting in death row

[Chorus]
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, guns of Brixton

[Pre-Verse]
The money feels good
And your life you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven, as in hell

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You see, he feels like Ivan
Born under the Brixton sun
His game is called survivin'
At the end of The Harder They Come
You know it means no mercy
They caught him with a gun
No need for the Black Maria
Goodbye to the Brixton sun
[Chorus]
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton

[Verse 1]
When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun?

[Chorus]
You can crush us
You can bruise us
You can even shoot us
But, oh the guns of Brixton

[Verse 3]
Shot down on the pavement
Waiting in death row
His game was survivin'
As in heaven, as in hell

[Chorus]
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, guns of Brixton
Oh, guns of Brixton
Oh, guns of Brixton
Oh, guns of Brixton
Oh, guns of Brixton[Intro]
Say, where did I see this guy?

[Verse 1]
In Red River?
Or A Place in the Sun?
Maybe The Misfits?
Or From Here to Eternity?

[Chorus]
Can everybody say, "Is he all right?"
And everybody say, "What's he like?"
And everybody say, "He sure look funny"
That's Montgomery Clift, honey!

[Verse 2]
New York, (New York) New York, 42nd Street
Hustlers rustle and pimp pimp the beat
Monty Clift is recognized at dawn
He ain't got no shoes and his clothes are torn

[Chorus]
And everybody say, "Is he all right?"
Can everybody say, "What's he like?"
Everybody say, "He sure look funny"
That's just Montgomery Clift, honey!
[Verse 3]
I see a car smashed at night
Cut the applause and dim the light
Monty's face is broken on a wheel
Is he alive? Can he still feel?

[Chorus]
And everybody say, "Is he all right?"
And everybody say, "Shine the light!"
Everybody say, "It's not funny"
That's Montgomery Clift, honey!

[Bridge]
Shoot his right profile

[Chorus]
Everybody say, "Is he all right?"
And everybody say, "What's he like?"
Everybody say, "He sure look funny"
That's Montgomery Clift, honey!

[Verse 4]
Nembutol
Numbs it all
But I prefer
Alcohol
[Chorus]
And everybody say, "What's he like?"
And everybody say, "Is he all right?"
Everybody say, "He sure look funny"
That's Montgomery Clift, honey!

[Verse 5]
He said go out and get me my old movie stills
Go out and get me another roll of pills
Everything's shakin', but I ain't got the chills

[Chorus]
And everybody say, "What's he like?"
And everybody say, "Is he all right?"
Everybody say, "He sure look funny"
"I was trapped!" Montgomery Clift, honey![Intro]
Stagger Lee met Billy and they got down to gambling
Stagger Lee throwed seven
Billy said that he throwed eight, hey
So Billy said, "Hey Stagger! I'm gonna make my big attack
I'm gonna have to leave my knife in your back"
(C'mon, let's start all over again)

[Verse 1]
Why do you try to cheat?
And trample people under your feet

To cheat the tryin' man
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?)
To cheat the tryin' man
But you better stop
It is the wrong 'em boyo

[Verse 2]
You lie, steal, cheat and deceit

To cheat the tryin' man
You better stop
It is the wrong 'em boyo

You say you stand by your man
So tell me something I don't understand
You said you love me and that's a fact
And then you left me, said you felt trapped
Well some things you can explain away
But the heartache's in me 'til this day

[Chorus]
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way

[Verse 2]
All the times when we were close
I'll remember these things the most
I see all my dreams come tumblin' down
I can't be happy without you around
So alone I keep the wolves at bay
And there's only one thing I can say

[Chorus]
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way
[Bridge]
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all

[Verse 3]
Now I got a job, but it don't pay
I need new clothes, I need somewhere to stay
But without all these things I can do
But without your love, I won't make it through
But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do

[Chorus]
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way

[Verse 4]
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?
[Outro]
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all
Did you stand by me?
No waynullCharlie don't surf and we think he should
Charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good
Charlie don't surf for his hamburger Momma
Charlie's going to be a napalm star

Everybody wants to rule the world
Must be something we get from birth
One truth is we never learn
Satellites will make space burn
We've been told to keep the strangers out
We don't like them starting to hang around
We don't like them all over town
Across the world we are going to blow them down

(Chorus)

The reign of the super powers must be over
So many armies can't free the earth
Soon the rock will roll over
Africa is choking on their Coca Cola
It's a one a way street in a one horse town
One way people starting to brag around
You can laugh, put them down
These one way people going to blow us down

(Chorus)

Charlie don't surf he'll never learn
Charlie don't surf though he's got a gun
Charlie don't surf think that he should
Charlie don't surf we really think he should
Charlie don't surf[Verse 1]

They say the immigrants steal the hubcaps
Of respected gentlemen
They say it would be wine and roses
If England were for Englishmen again

I saw a dirty overcoat
At the foot of the pillar of the road
Propped inside was an old man
Who time could not erode
The night was snapped by sirens
Those blue lights circled past
The dance hall called for an ambulance
The bars all closed up fast

My silence gazing at the ceiling
While roaming the single room
I thought the old man could help me
If he could explain the gloom
"You really think it's all new
You really think about it too"
The old man scoffed as he spoke to me
"I'll tell you a thing or two"

(Joe Strummer)
I missed the fourteen-eighteen war
But not the sorrow afterwards
With my father dead, my mother ran off
My brothers took the pay of hoods
The twenties turned the north was dead
The hunger strike came marching south
The garden party not a word was said
The ladies lifted cake to their mouths

The next war began and my ship sailed
With battle orders writ in red
In five long years of bullets and shells
We left ten million dead
The few returned to old Piccadilly
We limped around Leicester Square
The world was busy rebuilding itself
The architects could not care

But how could we know when I was young
All the changes that were to come?
All the photos in the wallets on the battlefield
And now the terror of the scientific sun
There was masters and servants and servants and dogs
They taught you how to touch your cap
Through strikes and famine and war and peace
England never closed this gap

So leave me now the moon is up
But remember the tales I tell
The memories that you have dredged up
Are on letters forwarded from Hell"

It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go

Goodbye, Piccadilly
Farewell, Leicester Square

(Mick Jones)
The streets were now deserted
The gangs had trudged off home
The lights clicked out in the bedsits
Old England was all aloneOh! Mama, Mama look there
Your children are playing in that street again
Don't you know what happened down there?
A youth of fourteen got shot down there
The Kokane guns of Jamdown town
The killing clowns, the blood money men
Are shooting those Washington bullets again

As every cell in Chile will tell
The cries of the tortured men
Remember Allende and the days before
Before the army came
Please remember Víctor Jara, in the Santiago stadium
Es verdad, those Washington bullets again

And in the Bay of Pigs in 1961
Havana fought the playboy in the Cuban sun
For Castro is a color is a redder than red
Those Washington bullets want Castro dead
For Castro is the color
That will earn you a spray of lead

Sandinista

For the very first time ever
When they had a revolution in Nicaragua
There was no interference from America
Human rights in America
The people fought the leader and up he flew
With no Washington bullets what else could he do?

Sandinista

An' if you can find a Afghan rebel
That the Moscow bullets missed
Ask him what he thinks of voting communist
Ask the Dalai Lama in the hills of Tibet
How many monks did the Chinese get?
In a war torn swamp stop any mercenary
An' check the British bullets in his armory

Sandinista
¿Qué?

Sandinista
SandinistaThey cried the tears, they shed the fears
Up and down the land
They stole guitars or used guitars
So the tape would understand
Without even the slightest hope of a thousand sales
Just as if, as if there was, Hitsville in UK
I know the boy was all alone, 'til the Hitsville hit UK

(Remember)
They say true talent will always emerge in time
When lightning hits Small Wonder
Its Fast Rough Factory time
No expense accounts, or lunch discounts
Or hyping up the charts
The band went in, and knocked 'em dead, in 2 minutes 59
I know the boy was all alone, 'til the Hitsville hit UK
So   hit it

No slimy deals, with smarmy eels in Hitsville UK
Lets shake'n say, we'll operate in Hitsville UK
I know the girl felt all alone, 'til the Hitsville hit UK

The mutants, creeps, and musclemen
Are shakin' like a leaf
It blows a hole in the radio
When it hasn't sounded good all week
A mike 'n boom, in your livin' room in Hitsville UK
No consumer trials, nor A.O.R., in Hitsville UK
I know the boy felt all alone 'til the Hitsville hit UK
Now the boys and girls are not alone
Now that Hitsville hit UK
I know the boys and girls are not alone
Now that Hitsville hit UK
I know the boys and girls are not alone
Now that Hitsville hit UK
I know the boys and girls are not alone
Now that Hitsville hit UK[Intro]
The Magnificent Seven!

[Chorus]
Ring! Ring! It's 7:00 A.M.!
Move yourself to go again
Cold water in the face
Brings you back to this awful place
Knuckle merchants and you bankers, too
Must get up and learn those rules
Weather man and the crazy chief
One says "Sun" and one says "Sleet"
A.M., the F.M. the P.M. too
Churnin' out that boogaloo
Gets you up and a'gets you out
But how long can you keep it up?
Gimme Honda, gimme Sony
So cheap and real phony
Hong Kong dollar, Indian cents
English pounds and Eskimo pence

[Post-Chorus]
You lot! What?
Don't stop, give it all you got
You lot! What?
Don't stop, yeah!
You lot! What?
Don't stop, give it all you got
You lot! What?
Don't stop, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Workin' for a rise, better my station
Take my baby to Sophistication
She's seen the ads, she thinks it's nice
Better work hard, I seen the price
Never mind that, it's time for the bus
We got to work, and you're one of us
Clocks go slow in a place of work
Minutes drag and the hours jerk

[Bridge]
"When can I tell 'em wot I do?
In a second, maaan, a'right Chuck!"

[Pre-Chorus]
Wave bub-bub-bub-bye to the boss
It's our profit, it's his loss
But anyway, the lunch bell ring
Take one hour, and do your... thang!
Cheeseboiger!

[Verse 3]
What do we have for entertainment?
Cops kickin' gypsies on the pavement
Now the news, a'snap to attention
The lunar landing of the dentist convention
Italian mobster shoots a lobster
Seafood restaurant gets outta hand
A car in the fridge, a fridge in the car?
Like cowboys do, in TV land

[Pre-Chorus]
You lot! What?
Don't stop, give it all you got
You lot! What?
Don't stop, oh!
You lot! What?
Don't stop, give it all you got, yeah
You lot! What?
Don't stop

[Chorus]
So get back to work and sweat some more
The sun will sink and we'll get out the door
It's no good for man to work in cages
Hits the town, he drinks his wages
You're frettin', you're sweatin'
But did you notice you ain't gettin'?
You're frettin', you're sweatin'
But did you notice not gettin' anywhere?
Don't you ever stop a'long enough to start?
Take your car outta that gear
Don't you ever stop long enough to start?
Get your car outta that gear
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
Came to the checkout at the 7-11
Marx was skint, but he had sense
Engels lent him the necessary pence

[Post-Chorus]
What have we got? Yeah
A'what have we got? Yeah-o
What have we got? Magnificence (I say)
What have we got?

[Chorus]
Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi
Went to the park to check on the game
But they was murdered by the other team
Who went on to win 15-nil
You can't be true, you can't be false
You'll be given the same reward
Socrates and Milhous Nixon
Both went the same way, through the kitchen
Plato the Greek or Rin Tin Tin
Who's more famous to the billion millions?
News Flash
Vacuum Cleaner Sucks Up Budgie
Ooh hoo!
Bye bye

[Post-Chorus]
The Magnificent Seven!
Magnificent!

[Outro]
Magnificent Seven!
This is fuckin' long, innit?They offered me the office, offered me the shop
They said I'd better take anything they'd got
Do you wanna make tea at the BBC?
Do you wanna be, do you really wanna be a cop?

Career opportunity the one that never knocks
Every job they offer you is to keep you out the dock
Career opportunity, the one that never knocks

I hate the army and I hate the RAF
I don't wanna go fighting in the tropical heat
I hate the civil service rules
I won't open letter bombs for you

Career opportunity the one that never knock
Every job they offer you is to keep you out the dock
Career opportunity, the one that never knock

Oi!
Bus driver
Ambulance man
Ticket inspector
I don't understand

They're gonna have to introduce conscription
They're gonna have to take away my prescription
If they wanna get me makin' toys
If they wanna get me, well I got no choice

Career opportunity the one that never knock
Every job they offer you is to keep you out the dock
Career opportunity, the one that never knock

Career
Career
Career
It ain't never gonna knock[Verse 1]
Yankee soldier
He wanna shoot some skag
He met it in Cambodia
But now he can't afford a bag
Yankee dollar talk
To the dictator of the world
In fact it's giving orders
And they can't afford to miss a word

[Chorus]
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
But what can I do?

[Verse 2]
Yankee detectives
Are always on the TV
Because killers in America
Work seven days a week
Never mind the stars and stripes
Let's play the Watergate Tapes
I'll salute the New Wave
And I hope nobody escapes

[Chorus]
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
But what can I do?

I'm so bored with the U.S.A
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
But what can I do?

I'm so bored with the U.S.A
I'm so bored with the U.S.A
But what can I do?

Move up Starsky
For the C.I.A

He's in love with the rock' n' roll world
He's in love with getting stoned world
He's in love with Janie Jones' world
He don't like his borin' job, no

He's in love with the rock' n' roll world
He's in love with getting stoned world
He's in love with Janie Jones' world
He don't like his borin' job, no

[Verse 1]
And he knows what he got to do
He knows he's gonna have fun with you
You lucky lady
And he knows when the evenin' comes
When his job is done he'll be over in his car for you

[Chorus]
He's in love with the rock' n' roll world
He's in love with getting stoned world
He's in love with Janie Jones' world
He don't like his borin' job, no

[Verse 2]
And in the in-tray lots of work
But the boss at the firm always thinks he shirks
But he's just like everyone, he got a Ford Cortina
That just won't run without fuel
Fill her up, Jacko

[Chorus]
He's in love with the rock' n' roll world
He's in love with getting stoned world
He's in love with Janie Jones' world
He don't like his borin' job, no

[Verse 3]
And the invoice it don't quite fit
No payola'r in his alphabetical file
'Cept for the government, man
An' he's just gonna really tell the boss
Gonna really let him know exactly how he feels
It's pretty bad

[Chorus]
He's in love with the rock' n' roll world
He's in love with getting stoned world
He's in love with Janie Jones' world
He don't like his borin' job, no

[Outro]
Oh
Oh
Let them know
Let them knowLondon's burnin'! London's burnin'!

All across the town, all across the night
Everybody's drivin' with full headlights
Black or white ya' turn it on, ya' face the new religion
Everybody's sittin' 'round watching television!

London's burnin' with boredom now
London's burning dial 99999
London's burnin' with boredom now
London's burnin' dial 99999

I'm up and down the Westway, in and out the lights
What a great traffic system, it's so bright
I can't think of a better way to spend the night
Than speedin' around underneath the yellow lights

(Chorus)

Now I'm in the subway and I'm lookin' for the flat
This one leads to this block, this one leads to that
The wind howls through the empty blocks looking for a home
I run through the empty stone because I'm all alone

(Chorus)
(Here we go)

(inaudible shouting)

London's burnin'![Verse 1]
Who needs remote control
From the Civic Hall
Push a button
Activate
You got to work, you're late

[Verse 2]
It's so grey in London town
With a Panda car crawlin' around
Here it comes
Eleven o'clock
Where can we go now?

[Chorus]
Can't make a noise
Can't get no gear
Can't make no money
Can't get outta here

[Verse 3]
Big business it don't like you
It don't like the things ya' do
They got no money
They got no power
They think you're useless
An' so you are, punk!

[Verse 4]
They had a meeting in Mayfair
They got ya' down and
They want to keep you there
It makes them worried
Their bank accounts
That's all that matters
You don't count

[Chorus]
Can't make no progress
Can't get ahead
Can't stop the regress
Don't wanna be dead

(Look out those rules and regulations)

[Verse 5]
Who needs the Parliament
Sittin' makin' laws all day
They're all fat and old
Queuin' for the House of Lords
Repression (gonna start on Tuesday)
Repression (gonna be a Dalek)
Repression (I am a robot)
Repression (I obey)[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own

[Verse 1]
Black man got a lotta problems
But they don't mind throwin' a brick
White people go to school
Where they teach you how to be real thick

[Bridge]
Everybody's doin'
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail!

[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own

[Verse 2]
All the power's in the hands
Of the people rich enough to buy it
While we walk the street
Too chicken to even try it
[Bridge]
Everybody's doin'
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail!

[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own

Or are ya' takin' orders?
Are ya' goin' backwards
Or are ya' goin' forwards?

[Chorus]
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own[Verse 1]
They said, "Release 'Remote Control'"
But we didn't want it on the label
They said, "Fly to Amsterdam"
The people laughed, but the press went mad
Oh, someone's really smart
Oh, complete control, yeah that's a laugh

[Verse 2]
On the last tour my mates they couldn't get in
I'd open up the back door but they'd get run out again
And at every hotel we was a'met by the law
Come for the party, come to make sure
Oh, have we done something wrong?
Oh, complete control, even over this song

[Bridge]
You’re my guitar hero

[Chorus]
They said we'd be artistically free
When we signed that bit of paper
They meant "Let's make a lots of money
And worry about it later"
Oh, I'll never understand
Oh, complete control, let me see your other hand
[Verse 3]
I don’t trust you, so why should you trust me?
Huh?
All over the news spread fast
They’re dirty, they're filthy, they ain't a'gonna last
This is Joe Public (Control) speaking
I'm controlled in the body (C-O-N control)
Controlled in the mind
This is the top rockers (Control)
With your zone in the price you whore (C-O-N control)
Comes to me

[Bridge]
Total, C-O-N control
Total, (parent, control) C-O-N control

[Outro]
We’ve got the rock ‘n’ roll (C-O-N control)
That means you
I kick it, I fight it, I gotta get up at it (C-O-N control)
I gotta kick itAnd I wanna move the town to the Clash City rockers
Ya' need a little jump of electrical shocker
Better leave town if you only wanna knock us
Nothing stands the pressure of the Clash City rockers

See them as they come down the escalator
Now listen to the tube train accelerator
Then ya' realize that you've gotta have a purpose
Or this place is gonna knock you out sooner or later

(So don't complain) about your useless employment
Jack it in forever tonight
(Or shut your mouth) and pretend you enjoy it
Think of all the money you've got

And I want to liquefy everybody gone dry
Or plug into the aerial that poke up in the sky
Burn down the suburbs with the half-closed eyes
You won't succeed unless you try

(So don't complain) about your useless employment
Jack it in forever tonight
(Or shut your mouth) and pretend you enjoy it
Think of all the money you've got
Yeah, yeah
Yes, I wanna move the town to the Clash City rockers
Ya' need a little jump of electrical shocker
(?) town if ya' only wanna knock us
Nothing stands the pressure of the Clash City rockers

You owe me a move say the bells of St. Groove
Come on and show me say the bells of Old Bowie
When I am fitter say the bells of Gary Glitter
No one but you and I say the bells of Prince Far-I
No one but you and I say the bells of Prince Far-I

And I wanna move the town to the Clash City rockers
Ya' need a little jump of electrical shockers
Better leave town if ya' only wanna knock us
Nothing stands the pressure of the Clash City rockers

Rock rock Clash City rockers (x9)[Intro]
1,2, a'1, 2,3,4

[Verse 1]
Ooh
Midnight to six, man
For the first time from Jamaica
Dillinger and a'Leroy Smart
Delroy Wilson, your cool operator

[Verse 2]
Ken Boothe for UK pop reggae
With backin' bands sound systems
If they got anything to say
There's many black ears here to listen

[Verse 3]
But it was Four Tops all night with encores from stage right
Charging from the bass knives to the treble
But onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel
Onstage they ain't got no...roots rock rebel

[Bridge]
(Dress back, jump back, this is a bluebeat attack)

[Verse 4]
'Cause it won't get you anywhere
Foolin' with the guns
The British Army is waitin' out there
An' it weighs fifteen hundred tons
[Verse 5]
White youth, black youth
Better find another solution
Why not phone up a'Robin Hood
And ask him for some wealth distribution?

[Verse 6]
Punk rocker in the UK
They won't notice anyway
They're all too busy fightin'
For a good place under the lightin'

[Verse 7]
The new groups are not concerned
With what there is to be learned
They got Burton suits, huh, ya' think it's funny
Turnin' rebellion into money

[Verse 8]
All over people changin' their votes
Along with their overcoats
If Adolf Hitler flew in today
They'd send a limousine anyway

[Verse 9]
I'm the all-night drug-prowling' wolf
Who looks so sick in the sun
I'm the white man in the Palais
Just a'lookin' for fun
Only lookin' for fun
[Bridge]
Oh, please mister
Just leave me alone

[Outro]
I'm only
Lookin' for fun[Chorus]
Breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won

[Verse]
I left my baby and it feels so bad
I guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a

[Pre-Chorus]
Robbin' people with a six-gun
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I lost my girl and I lost my fun
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won

[Chorus]
Breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won

[Outro]
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won

Giving deadly exhibitions of murder by napalm
