[Verse 1]
Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a wind swept field
Standing alone my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

[Chorus]
Can’t keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

[Verse 2]
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A soul in tension that’s learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try

[Chorus]
Can’t keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

[Verse 3]
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There’s no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

[Chorus]
Can’t keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you
And what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

[Chorus 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

[4:56 - 19:11 - Instrumental]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

[Chorus 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky

[Instrumental Outro][Instrumental]

[Break: Nick Mason]
One of these days, I’m going to cut you into little pieces

[Instrumental][Intro]

[Verse 1: Roy Harper]
Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar, you're gonna go far
You're gonna fly high, you're never gonna die
You're gonna make it if you try, they're gonna love you
Well, I've always had a deep respect an' I mean that most sincerely
The band is just fantastic, that is really what I think
Oh, by the way, which one's Pink?

[Chorus: Roy Harper]
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it riding the gravy train

[Verse 2: Roy Harper]
We're just knocked out, we heard about the sell-out
You gotta get an album out, you owe it to the people
We're so happy we can hardly count
Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart?
It's a hell of a start, it could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team

[Chorus: Roy Harper]
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it riding the gravy train

[Part 4 (8:40-11:08)]

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Remember when you were young
You shone like the Sun

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Verse 4: Roger Waters]
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on (Shine on), you crazy diamond (You crazy diamond)

[Chorus 2: Roger Waters]
Well, you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
Come on, you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine

[Part 7 (4:38 - 6:02)]

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Nobody knows where you are
How near or how far

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on you crazy diamond

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Pile on many more layers
And I'll be joining you there

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on you crazy diamond

[Chorus: Roger Waters]
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on, you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on, you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!

[Part 8 (6:02 - 9:00): Instrumental]

[Part 9 (9:00 - 12:27): Instrumental][Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Welcome, my son
Welcome to the machine
Where have you been?
It's alright, we know where you've been
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time
Provided with toys and 'Scouting for Boys'
You bought a guitar to punish your ma
You didn't like school
And you know you're nobody's fool
So welcome to the machine

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Welcome, my son
Welcome to the machine
What did you dream?
It's alright, we told you what to dream
You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar
So welcome to the machine
[Synthesizer Solo]

[Outro][Spoken Intro]
— And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes
Now which is it?
I am sure of it

[Acoustic Guitar Intro]

[Verse]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change, did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
Runnin' over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

[Instrumental Outro & Scatting][Verse 1: David Gilmour]
You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

[Instrumental: 03:05 - 6:46]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

[Interlude: 08:03 - 12:15]
(Stone, stone, stone...)

[Verse 4: Roger Waters]
Got to admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze
Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer

[Instrumental: 13:26 - 15:19]

[Verse 5: Roger Waters]
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone
Who was dragged down by the stone[Verse: Roger Waters]
If you didn't care what happened to me
And I didn't care for you
We would zigzag our way through the boredom and pain
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
And watching for pigs on the wing[Intro]
*Pig snorts*

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Big man, pig man
Haha, charade you are
Wooh!
You well-heeled big wheel
Haha, charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You're nearly a good laugh, almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin
Sayin', "Keep on digging"
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find
Down in the pig mine?

[Refrain: Roger Waters]
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh, but you're really a cry

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Bus stop rat bag
Haha, charade you are
You fucked up old hag
Haha, charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
You're hot stuff with a hatpin
And good fun with a handgun

[Refrain: Roger Waters]
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh, but you're really a cry

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Hey you, Whitehouse
Haha, charade you are
You house proud town mouse
Haha, charade you are
You're tryin' to keep our feelings off the street
You're nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?
You! Gotta stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside

[Refrain: Roger Waters]
Mary, you're nearly a treat
Mary, you're nearly a treat, but you're really a cry

[Instrumental Outro][Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen
Things are not what they seem

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
What do you get for pretending the danger's not real
Meek and obedient, you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel
What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

[Interlude]
(stone, stone, stone...)
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives He releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection, and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream
Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old[Instrumental][Verse 1: Roger Waters]
The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more

[Chorus: Roger Waters]
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

[Verse 2: Roger Waters & Peter Watts]
The lunatic is in my head (Hahahahahahaha!)
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade
You make the change
You rearrange me till I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
And there's someone in my head but it's not me

[Chorus: Roger Waters]
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

[Outro: Peter Watts & Patricia Watts]
I can't think of anything to say except
Hahahahahahaha!
I think it's marvellous!
Hahaha...[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground

[Chorus]
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

[Verse 2]
Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

[Chorus]
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave[Verse: Roger Waters]
All that you touch and all that you see
All that you taste, all you feel
And all that you love and all that you hate
All you distrust, all you save
And all that you give and all that you deal
And all that you buy, beg, borrow, or steal
And all you create and all you destroy
And all that you do and all that you say
And all that you eat and everyone you meet (Everyone you meet)
And all that you slight and everyone you fight
And all that is now and all that is gone
And all that's to come and everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

[Outro]
There is no dark side in the moon really
Matter of fact it's all dark
*Heartbeat*[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Money, get away
You get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Ah, don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

[Saxophone Solo]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise, it's no surprise
That they're giving none away

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, ooh...

[Spoken Outro: Interview excerpts]
- Yeah -- (chuckles) -- I was in the right!
- Yes, absolutely in the right!
- I certainly was in the right!
- Yeah, I was definitely in the right; that geezer was cruising for a bruising...
- Yeah
- Why does anyone do anything?
- I don't know, I was really drunk at the time...
- I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out[Instrumental]

[00:27]
Have your baggage and your passports ready and follow the green line to customs and then to immigration. BA 215 to Rome, Cairo and Lagos

[01:54: Roger Manifold]
Live for today, gone tomorrow. That's me
*Laughs*[Intro]
[heartbeat]

[Spoken: Chris Adamson, Gerry O'Driscoll, Peter Watts, and Clare Torry]
I've been mad for fucking years
Absolutely years, been over the edge for yonks
Been working me buns off for bands
I've always been mad, I know I've been mad
Like the most of us have
Very hard to explain why you're mad
Even if you're not mad
Hahahahahahaha!
Ah-ah-ah...[Intro: Gerry O'Driscoll]
I am not frightened of dying
Any time will do, I don't mind
Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime

[Lyricless vocals: Clare Torry]

[Bridge: Patricia Watts]
I never said I was frightened of dying

[Lyricless vocals: Clare Torry][Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour &amp; Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour &amp; Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Us (Us, us, us, us, us) and them (Them, them, them, them)
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me (Me, me, me, me, me) and you (You, you, you, you, you)
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
"Forward" he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
The general sat and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Black (Black, black, black, black) and blue (Blue, blue, blue, blue)
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up (Up, up, up, up, up) and down (Down, down, down, down)
And in the end it's only round and round, and round
"Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried
"Listen, son," said the man with the gun
"There's room for you inside"

[Interlude]
I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So like, if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again
Dig it? I mean he get off lightly
'Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of opinion
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Down (Down, down, down, down) and out (Out, out, out, out)
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
With (With, with, with, with), without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
"Is that Charlie? Hello Charlie!
Great..."[Intro]

[Verse 1]
We bitch and we fight
Diss each other on sight
But this thing we do
These times together
Rain or shine or stormy weather
This thing we do
With world-weary grace
We've taken our places
We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name
Or stay home by the fire, filled by desire
Stoking the flame
But we’re here for the ride

[Hook]
It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words

[Verse 2]
The strings bend and slide
As the hours glide by
An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues
Gonna tap out the rhythm
Let's go with the flow, wherever it goes
We're more than alive

[Hook]
It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
This thing they call soul
Is there with a pulse
Louder than words
Louder than words

[Guitar solo]

[Outro][Verse 1]
Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies
I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide
If you negotiate the minefield in the drive
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall
Dial the combination, open the priesthole
And if I'm in I'll tell you (What's behind the wall)

(Yahoo!)

[Verse 2]
There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith
Could anybody love him
Or is it just a crazy dream?

[Verse 3]
And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do?
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone?
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?

[Verse 4]
Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down
I held the blade in trembling hands
Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang
I never had the nerve to make the final cut

[Outro]
“Hello? Listen, I think I've got it."
"Okay, listen, it's a- Hahahaha!”[Intro]
"Moon in both [houses]..." 
"...Scorpio, [Arabian Skies], Libra..." 
"...Pluto was not discovered until 1930..."

[Verse 1]
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker, blam
Pow, pow
Stairway scare Dan Dare who’s there?

[Verse 3]
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters underground[Verse 1]
I’ve got a bike, you can ride it if you like
It’s got a basket, a bell that rings
And things to make it look good
I’d give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

[Chorus]
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want things

[Verse 2]
I’ve got a cloak it’s a bit of a joke
There’s a tear up the front
It’s red and black, I’ve had it for months
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should

[Chorus]
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want things

[Verse 3]
I know a mouse, and he hasn’t got a house
I don’t know why I call him Gerald
He’s getting rather old, but he’s a good mouse

[Chorus]
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want things
[Verse 4]
I’ve got a clan of gingerbread men
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish. They’re on the dish

[Chorus]
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want things

[Verse 5/Outro]
I know a room of musical tunes
Some rhyme, some ching, most of them are clockwork
Let’s go into the other room and make them work

[Instrumental outro][Verse: Roger Waters]
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy, what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what d'ya leave behind for me?
All in all, it was just a brick in the wall
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Hey!
*Children's playing*[Intro]

[Verse 1: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!

[Chorus: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

[Verse 2: Islington Green School Students]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone!

[Chorus: Islington Green School Students]
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Wrong, do it again! *Children playing*
Wrong, do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
(Wrong, do it again!)
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
(Wrong, do it again!)
You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!
(If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?)
(You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!)
*Children playing*
*Phone beeping sound*[Intro]
*Sounds from TV*

[Verse: Roger Waters]
I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No, don't think I'll need anything at all

[Chorus: Roger Waters]
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all, you were all just bricks in the wall[Intro]

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

[Pre-Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus 2: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo 2][Hook: Roger Waters]
Ooh, babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder in front of my friends

[Hook: Roger Waters]
Oh, babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
(Need you, need you, need you, need you, need you, need you)
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night

[Hook: Roger Waters]
Oh, babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooh, babe, why are you running away?

[Outro: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, ooh
Argh![Instrumental Intro]

[Verse: Roger Waters]
What shall we use to fill the empty spaces
Where we used to talk?
How shall fill the final places?
How should I complete the wall?[Spoken Intro: Harry Waters]
Look Mummy
There's an airplane up in the sky

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
Did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone, but the pain lingers on

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye[Acoustic Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Hey you
Out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Hey you
Out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you
With your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out
Could you touch me?
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

[Breakdown]

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Hey you
Out there on the road, always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you
Out there beyond the wall, breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you
Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

[Outro: Roger Waters]
(We fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall...)[Intro]
"Three, two... fire!"

[Verse 1]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, doo-doo)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show (Doo-doo)
To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow
I've got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand

[Verse 2]
Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get them up against The Wall
(Against The Wall)
Now there's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against The Wall
(Against The-)
And that one looks Jewish and that one's a coon!
Who let all of this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint and another with spots
If I had my way, I'd have all of ya shot!

[Instrumental Outro][Prelude]
...we came in?

[Verse: Roger Waters]
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow
Tell me is something eluding you, sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Lights!
Roll the sound effects!
Action!
Drop it, drop it on 'em
Drop it on them!
*Shots*

[Outro]
*Baby crying*[Intro]
"Well, only got an hour of daylight left. Better get started"
"Isn't it unsafe to travel at night?"
"It'll be a lot less safe to stay here. Your father's gonna pick up our trail before long"
"Can Lorca ride?"
"He'll have to ride. Lorca, time to go! Chengra, thank you for everything. Let's go."
"Goodbye Chengra"
" Goodbye, Missy!"
"I'll be back--one day"

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Ah, is there anybody out there?

[Instrumental Outro][Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Mother, should I build the wall?

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Is it just a waste of time?

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mamma's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mamma's gonna keep you right here, under her wing
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Mamma's gonna keep baby cosy and warm
Ooh babe, ooh babe
Ooh babe
Of course, Mamma's gonna help build the wall

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Mother, do you think she's good enough–for me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous–to me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Mother, will she break my heart?
[Chorus 2: David Gilmour]
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mamma won't let anyone dirty get through
Mamma's gonna wait up until you get in
Mamma will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean
Ooh babe, ooh babe
Ooh babe
You'll always be baby to me

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Mother, did it need to be so high?[Intro]
"But there's somebody else that needs taking care of in Washington.."
"Who's that?"
"Rose Pilchitt!"
"Rose Pilchitt? Who's that?"
*Kid screams in background*
(Shut up!)
"36-24-36 *laughs* does that answer your question?"
(Oi! I've got a little black book with me poems in!)
"Who's she?"
"She was 'Miss Armoured Division' in 1961... "

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
I've got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation

[Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There will be nobody home

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to (fly to.. fly to.. fly to..)

[Chorus 2: Roger Waters]
Ooh, babe, when I pick up the phone
("Surprise, surprise, surprise...")
There's still nobody home

[Outro: Roger Waters]
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
And I've got fading roots[Intro]
"Oh my God! What a fabulous room! Are all these your guitars?"
("I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to startle you")
"God! This place is bigger than our apartment!"
("Let me know when you're entering a room")
("Yes, sir")
"Um, can I get a drink of water?"
("I was wondering about")
"You want some, huh?"
("Yes")
"Oh wow! Hey, look at this tub! Wanna take a bath?"
("I'll have to find out from Mrs. Bancroft what time she wants to meet us, for her main")
"What are you watching?"
("If you'll just let me know as soon as you can, Mrs. Bancroft... Mrs. Bancroft")
"Hello?"
("I don't understand")
"Are you feeling okay?"

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Day after day, the love turns gray
Like the skin of the dying man
And night after night, we pretend it's all right
But I have grown older, and you have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade, tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum
[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened, this is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV? Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat? Would you like to learn to fly?
Would ya? Would you like to see me try?
Ah, no!

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?[Verse]
All alone, or in twos
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down, outside the wall
Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands
The bleeding hearts and the artists make their stand
And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall

[Outro]
Isn't this where...[Instrumental Intro/Guitar Riff]

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
You better make your face up with your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down your door
You better run!

[Instrumental Pre-Chorus/Guitar Riff]

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run!

[Synth Solo]

[Instrumental Outro][Intro: Roger Waters]
You! Yes, you!
Stand still, Laddy!

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would hurt the children
In any way they could (oof!)
By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids (*Laughs*)

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
But in the town, it was well known when they got home at night Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Momma loves her baby
And daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you, babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooh babe, ooh baby blue
Ooh babe

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes
Don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you as you claw the thin ice[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Prosecutor]
Good morning, Worm your honour
The crown will plainly show the prisoner
Who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do
Call the schoolmaster!

[Verse 2: The Schoolmaster]
I always said he'd come to no good in the end your honour
If they'd let me have my way I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied, the bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder, let me hammer him today

[Chorus 1: Pink (and Choir)]
Crazy, toys in the attic
I am crazy, truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away!
(Crazy, toys in the attic, he is crazy)

[Verse 3: Wife]
You little shit, you're in it now, I hope they throw away the key
You should have talked to me more often than you did, but no!
You had to go your own way
Have you broken any homes up lately?
"Just five minutes, Worm your honour, him and me, alone"

[Verse 4: Mother]
Babe!
Come to mother baby, let me hold you in my arms
M'lud I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your honour, let me take him home

[Chrous 2: Pink (and Choir)]
Crazy, over the rainbow
I am crazy, bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in
(Crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy)

[Verse 5: The Judge]
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for the jury to retire
In all my years of judging, I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate
(Go on, Judge, shit on him!)
Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers
Tear down the wall!

[Outro: Crowd]
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
*Explosion*
*Bricks crumbling*[Intro]
"Where the hell are you?
Where the hell are you, Simon?" *Shots*

[Verse: Roger Waters]
Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?
Remember how she said that
We would meet again some sunny day?
Vera, Vera, what has become of you?
Does anybody else in here feel the way I do?[Intro]
"Eins, zwei, drei, alle!"
Ooh-ooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooh-ooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come (Worms to come)
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Testing. One. Two. One. Two. We’re all going to convene at 1:15 outside Brixton Town Hall where we will be going...

[Hook: Roger Waters]
(Waiting) To cut out the deadwood
(Waiting) To clean up the city
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To put on a black shirt
(Waiting) To weed out the weaklings
(Waiting) To smash in their windows and kick in their doors
(Waiting) For the final solution to strengthen the strain
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To turn on the showers and fire the ovens
(Waiting) For the queens and the coons and the reds and the Jews
(Waiting) To follow the worms

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Would you like to see Britannia Rule again
My friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again
My friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms

[Outro]
Stop![Verse 1: David Gilmour]
I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock and roll refugee
Ooh, baby, set me free

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

[Outro]
*Phone beeping*
"Hello?"
"Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd. Will you accept the charge from the United States?"
*Phone clicks*
"Oh, he hung up. That's your residence, right? Well, I wonder why he hung up. Is there supposed to be someone out there besides your wife there to answer?"
*Phone redials and beeps again*
"Hello?"
"This is the United States calling. Are we reaching..."
*Phone clicks*
"See, he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering."[Verse 1]
You say the hill’s too steep to climb
Chiding
You say you’d like to see me try
Climbing
You pick the place and I’ll choose the time

[Chorus 1]
And I will climb that hill in my own way
Just wait a while for the right day
And as I rise above the tree line and the clouds
I look down, hearing the sound of the things you’ve said today

[Verse 2]
Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling
Merciless the magistrate turns ’round
Frowning
And who’s the fool who wears the crown?

[Chorus 2]
And go down in your own way
And every day is the right day
And as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow
You look down, hearing the sound of the faces in the crowd

[Outro]
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
Liverpool! Liverpool!
