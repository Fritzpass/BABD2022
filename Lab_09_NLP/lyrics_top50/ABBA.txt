[Verse 1]
I, I've been in love before
I thought I would no more
Manage to hit the ceiling
Still, strange as it seems to me
You brought it back to me
That old feeling

[Verse 2]
I, I don't know what you do
You make me think that you
Possibly could release me
I think you'll be able to
Make all my dreams come true
And you ease me

[Chorus]
You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I'd been pleading for
I love you, I adore you
I've laid my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you

[Verse 3]
I, I'm gonna make you mine
You're gonna feel so fine
You'll never want to leave me
I feel you belong to me
Someday you will agree
Please, believe me

[Chorus]
You thrill me, you delight me
You please me, you excite me
You're something I'd been pleading for
I love you, I adore you
I've laid my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I've been waiting for you
Oh, I've been waiting for you

[Outro]
Na na na, na na na, na-na na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na-na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na-na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na-na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na
Na na na, na na na, na-na na-na[Verse 1]
Love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too? I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past
Now I just made it, I found you at last

[Verse 2]
So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Oh, no hard feelings between you and me
If we can't make it, but just wait and see

[Verse 3]
So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
So love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too? I do, I do, I do, I do, I do[Verse 1]
This park and these houses, old streets I have walked
Everything dear, will it be here
One day when I am returning?
My friends will get married, have children and homes
It sounds so nice, well-planned and wise
Never expecting surprises

[Chorus]
I wonder, it's frightening
Leaving now, is that the right thing?
I wonder, it scares me
But who the the hell am I if I don't even try?
I'm not a coward, oh no, I'll be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes, I will take it, it can't go wrong

[Verse 2]
My friends and my family, this dull little town
Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed
Everything old and familiar

[Chorus]
I wonder, it's frightening
Leaving now, is that the right thing?
I wonder, oh, it scares me
But who the the hell am I if I don't even try?
I'm not a coward, oh no, I'll be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes, I will take it
Yes, I will take it, it can't go wrong[Verse 1: Björn]
"They say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul
A voyager, and a settler, they both have a distant goal
If I explore the heavens, or if I search inside
Well, it really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself
I've always tried"

[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida &amp; Björn]
Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion, move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on

[Verse 2: Agnetha]
I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive
[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida &amp; Björn]
Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion, move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Agnetha]
The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain
The wonder of the moment
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain

[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida &amp; Björn]
Like a roller in the ocean
Life is motion, move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of, being in it
With the urge to move on
[Outro: Agnetha, Frida &amp; Björn]
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning
Life is dawning, move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of it, being in it
With the urge to move on
Like a wind that's always blowing
Life is flowing, move on
Like the sunrise in the morning...[Verse 1: Agnetha &amp; Frida]
I've seen you twice, in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted

[Pre-Chorus: Agnetha &amp; Frida]
I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

[Chorus: Agnetha &amp; Frida]
What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?

[Post-Chorus: Frida]
Tell me, please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow

[Bridge: Frida &amp; Agnetha]
And you make me talk (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me feel (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me show (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
What I'm trying to conceal (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I trust in you (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you let me down? (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you laugh at me (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I said I care for you? (Ah-ah)
Could you feel the same way too, I wanna know
The name of the game
[Verse 2: Agnetha &amp; Frida]
I have no friends, no one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

[Pre-Chorus: Agnetha &amp; Frida]
Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know

[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida &amp; Björn]
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Does it mean anything to you?
(Got a feeling you give me no choice, but it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do?

[Post-Chorus: Frida]
Tell me, please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow
[Bridge: Frida, Agnetha &amp; Frida]
And you make me talk (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me feel (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me show (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
What I'm trying to conceal (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I trust in you (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you let me down? (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you laugh at me (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I said I care for you? (Ah-ah)
Could you feel the same way too, I wanna know
Oh, yes, I wanna know

[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida &amp; Björn]
The name of the game
(I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?
(But I think I can see in your face that it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do?
(Got a feeling you give me no choice, but it means a lot)

[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida &amp; Björn]
The name of the game
(I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?
(But I think I can see in your face that it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it...[Verse 1]
They came flying from far away
Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell

[Verse 2]
They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand

[Pre-Chorus]
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

[Chorus]
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

[Verse 3]
As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything

[Verse 4]
There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

[Chorus]
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

[Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

[Chorus]
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please[Verse 1]
I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Verse 2]
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Bridge]
I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance

[Chorus]
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Outro]
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me[Intro]
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 1]
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 2]
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Outro]
Digging the dancing queen[Verse 1]
I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad?
And still, there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad

[Pre-Chorus]
In my dreams, I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball

[Chorus]
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
A-ha, ah
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

[Verse 2]
A man like that is hard to find, but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad?
And if he happens to be free, I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad

[Pre-Chorus]
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same

[Chorus]
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
A-ha, ah
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

[Chorus]
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
A-ha, ah
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

[Outro]
It's a rich man's world[Verse 1]
I've seen it on your face
Tells me more than any worn-out old phrase
So now we'll go separate ways
Never again we two
Never again, nothing I can do

[Chorus]
Like an image passing by
My love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love, my life
I can see it all so clearly (See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely (Answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?
Like reflections of your mind
My love, my life
Are the words you try to find
My love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only

[Verse 2]
I've watched you look away
Tell me, is it really so hard to say?
Oh, this has been my longest day
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through
[Chorus]
Like an image passing by
My love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love, my life
I can see it all so clearly (See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely (Answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?
Like reflections of your mind
My love, my life
Are the words you try to find
My love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Yes I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only[Verse 1]
Are you sure you wanna hear more?
What if I ain't worth the while
Not the style you'd be looking for?
If I'm sweet tonight
Things look different in the morning light
I'm jealous and I'm proud
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

[Verse 2]
Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Would I be the one you seek
Mild and meek like the girl next door?
Don't you realise
I may be an angel in disguise
It's lonely to be free
But I'm not a man's toy, I'll never be
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

[Bridge]
I don't believe in fairy tales
Sweet nothings in my ear
But I do believe in sympathy
That's me, you see
[Verse 3]
Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Won't you have a drink with me
Just to see you're not really sore?
I can't help my ways
I'm just not the girl to hide my face
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me, mhm
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

[Interlude]

[Outro]
There's a special love
Like an eagle flying with a dove
I'll find it in the end
If I keep on searching, but until then
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me[Verse 1]
Everybody screamed
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was

[Verse 2]
Taken by surprise (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Couldn't quite believe his eyes (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

[Chorus]
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

[Verse 3]
I was in a trance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Suddenly I took the chance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Leaning over me
He was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher
[Chorus]
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

[Verse 4]
What a crazy day (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
All my sense had flown away (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

[Outro]
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug...)[Verse 1: Björn]
When you were lonely, you needed a man
Someone to lean on, well I understand
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

[Chorus: Agnetha &amp; Frida]
I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

[Verse 2: Björn]
Men are the toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw 'em away
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

[Chorus: Agnetha &amp; Frida]
I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me[Verse 1: Frida]
No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Björn & Benny]
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

[Verse 2: Frida & Agnetha]
Memories, good days, bad days (Memories, good days, bad days)
They'll be with me always (They'll be with me always)
In these old familiar rooms, children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Björn & Benny]
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Björn & Benny]
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
[Verse 3]
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
[Outro]
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernandonull[Verse 1]
I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

[Verse 2]
You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking
[Pre-Chorus]
Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

[Outro]
Oh-oh, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Oh-oh, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring...[Verse 1]
Take it easy with me, please
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze
Take your time, make it slow
Andante, andante, just let the feeling grow

[Verse 2]
Make your fingers soft and light
Let your body be the velvet of the night
Touch my soul, you know how
Andante, andante, go slowly with me now

[Chorus]
I'm your music (I am your music and I am your song)
I'm your song (I am your music and I am your song)
Play me time and time again and make me strong
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)
Make me sing, make me sound
(You make me sing and you make me)
Andante, andante, tread lightly on my ground
Andante, andante, oh, please don't let me down

[Verse 3]
There's a shimmer in your eyes
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies
Please don't talk, go on, play
Andante, andante, and let me float away

[Chorus]
I'm your music (I am your music and I am your song)
I'm your song (I am your music and I am your song)
Play me time and time again and make me strong
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)
Make me sing, make me sound
(You make me sing and you make me)
Andante, andante, tread lightly on my ground
Andante, andante, oh, please don't let me down

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Make me sing, make me sound
(You make me sing and you make me)
Andante, andante, tread lightly on my ground
Andante, andante, oh, please don't let me down
Andante, andante, oh, please don't let me down[Verse 1]
I was at a party and this fella said to me
"Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree
People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights"

[Verse 2]
I said, "Who are you to talk about impending doom?"
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, "I'm a minister, a big shot in the state"
I said, "I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great
Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?"
He said, "Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone"

[Chorus]
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone

[Verse 3]
Over in the corner, I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar

[Verse 4]
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
He said, "Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?"
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
He said, "If you're going somewhere can I come along?"
I said, "Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone"

[Chorus]
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone
On and on and on
Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone
On and on and on
Till the night is gone[Verse 1]
The summer air was soft and warm
The feeling right, the Paris night
Did its best to please us
And strolling down the Élysées
We had a drink in each café
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy
And I smiled like Mona Lisa

[Pre-Chorus]
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

[Chorus]
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

[Verse 2]
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power
[Pre-Chorus]
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

[Chorus]
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
And now you're working in a bank
The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry
[Pre-Chorus]
How dull it seems
Yet you're the hero of my dreams

[Chorus]
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
We were living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer...[Intro: Frida &amp; Agnetha]
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you

[Verse 1: Frida]
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)

[Pre-Chorus: Frida]
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

[Chorus: Frida &amp; Agnetha, Benny &amp; Björn]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
[Verse 2: Frida]
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still, I'm thinking about you only
(Still, I'm thinking about you only)

[Pre-Chorus: Frida]
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be alright
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

[Chorus: Frida &amp; Agnetha, Benny &amp; Björn]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

[Bridge: Frida]
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms, and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
[Chorus: Frida &amp; Agnetha, Benny &amp; Björn]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

[Outro: Frida &amp; Agnetha, Benny &amp; Björn]
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per) ...lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do... (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)[Verse: Frida &amp; Agnetha]
You and I can share the silence
Finding comfort together
The way old friends do
And after fights and words of violence
We make up with each other
The way old friends do

[Chorus: Frida &amp; Agnetha]
Times of joy and times of sorrow
We will always see it through
Oh, I don't care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do

[Verse: Frida &amp; Agnetha]
You and I can share the silence
Finding comfort together
The way old friends do
And after fights and words of violence
We make up with each other
The way old friends do

[Chorus: Frida &amp; Agnetha]
Times of joy and times of sorrow
We will always see it through
Oh, I don't care what comes tomorrow
We can face it together
The way old friends do
[Outro: Frida &amp; Agnetha]
We can face it together
The way old friends do[Verse 1]
I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[Chorus]
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

[Verse 2]
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

[Chorus]
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)
[Verse 3]
But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

[Chorus]
The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

[Verse 4]
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence
[Bridge]
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

[Outro]
(So the winner)
(Takes it all)
(And the loser)
(Has to fall)
(Throw a dice)
(Cold as ice)
(Way down here)
(Someone dear)
(Takes it all)
(Has to fall)
(It seems plain)
(Why complain)[Verse 1]
They passed me by, all of those great romances
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

[Chorus]
One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

[Verse 2]
I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

[Pre-Chorus]
That's how I started the show, one of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

[Chorus]
One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

[Post-Chorus]
Never left at all

[Outro]
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call...[Verse 1]
Here's to us, one more toast, and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside, both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

[Verse 2]
In our lives, we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified, and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It's so strange, when you're down, and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done
[Outro]
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done[Verse 1]
I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

[Chorus]
Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

[Verse 2]
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, "Oh, that's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry"
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going
[Chorus]
Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

[Chorus]
Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean
[Outro]
(Think she's one of those who always has to do whatever she please)
And she goes head over heels[Verse 1: Agnetha]
I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

[Verse 2: Agnetha]
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came

[Vocalisations: Frida]

[Verse 3: Agnetha]
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of "Dallas" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

[Outro: Agnetha]
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came

[Vocalisations: Frida][Verse 1]
Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go
My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so
(You know that I'm nobody's fool)
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be

[Chorus]
Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

[Verse 2]
This is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no
(I'm kind of certain I suppose)
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what would happen, where I'd be if I fell
[Chorus]
Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing's gonna stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I won't know how

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody see and save a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure I would know how

[Outro]
Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover[Refrain]
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 1]
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
"Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play"

[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

[Refrain]
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes, angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

[Outro]
Keep thinking
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Keep thinking, had to pay the price
Keep thinking
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Keep thinking, had to pay the price
Keep thinking[Verso 1]
Chiquitita, dime por qué
Tu dolor hoy te encadena
En tus ojos hay, una sombra de gran pena
No quisiera verte así
Aunque quieras disimularlo
Si es que tan triste estás para qué quieres callarlo

[Verso 2]
Chiquitita, dímelo tu
En mi hombro, aquí llorando
Cuenta conmigo ya, para así seguir andando
Tan segura te conocí
Y ahora tu ala quebrada
(Duele verte triste)
(Y duele verte llorar)
Déjamela arreglar, yo la quiero ver curada

[Coro]
Chiquitita, sabes muy bien
Que las penas vienen
Y van y desaparecen
Otra vez vas a bailar
Y serás feliz
Como flores que florecen
Chiquitita, no hay que llorar
Las estrellas brillan por
Ti allá en lo alto
Quiero verte sonreír
Para compartir
Tu alegría, Chiquitita
Otra vez quiero compartir
Tu alegría Chiquitita
[Verso 3]
Chiquitita, dime por qué
Tu dolor hoy te encadena
En tus ojos hay, una sombra de gran pena
No quisiera verte así
Aunque quieras disimularlo
Si es que tan triste estás para qué quieres callarlo

[Coro]
Chiquitita, sabes muy bien
Que las penas vienen
Y van y desaparecen
Otra vez vas a bailar
Y serás feliz
Como flores que florecen
Chiquitita, no hay que llorar
Las estrellas brillan por
Ti allá en lo alto
Quiero verte sonreír
Para compartir
Tu alegría, Chiquitita
Otra vez quiero compartir
Tu alegría Chiquitita

[Outro]
Otra vez quiero compartir
Tu alegría Chiquitita[Verse 1]
Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

[Verse 2]
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now, I see you've broken a feather
(How it hurts to see you cry)
(And how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope we can patch it up together

[Chorus]
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
[Verse 3]
So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown-out candle
All is gone, and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

[Chorus]
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
(You and I, we know)
(How all the heartaches come and go)
You'll be dancing once again
(You’ll be dancing once again)
And the pain will end
(And all the pain you take will end)
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
[Outro]
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita[Verse 1]
You're so hot, teasing me
So you're blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl, you're only a child

[Chorus]
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

[Post-Chorus]
Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy, take it easy
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?
[Verse 2]
I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile
Smile, but girl, you're only a child

[Chorus]
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

[Post-Chorus]
Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy, take it easy
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?
[Chorus]
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe...[Verse 1]
Half-past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

[Chorus]
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

[Chorus]
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

[Bridge]
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme a man after midnight
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme a man after midnight

[Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

[Chorus]
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day[Verse 1]
I got appointments, work I have to do
Keeping me so busy all the day through
They're the things that keep me from thinking of you
Oh, baby, I miss you so, I know I'm never gonna make it
Oh, I'm so restless, I don't care what I say
And I lose my temper ten times a day
Still it's even worse when the night's on its way
It's bad, oh, so bad

[Chorus]
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sitting here alone and staring at the wall
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
No one to turn to, you know how it is
I was not prepared for something like this
Now I see them clearly, the things that I miss
Oh, baby, I feel so bad, I know I'm never gonna make it
I got my business to help me through the day
People I must write to, bills I must pay
But everything's so different when night's on its way
It's bad, oh, so bad

[Chorus]
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sitting here alone and staring at the wall
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
If it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
If it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)

[Chorus]
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)

[Chorus]
If it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
If it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights[Verse 1]
I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future, even if you fail

[Chorus]
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream

[Verse 2]
I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness; still another mile

[Chorus]
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail

[Chorus]
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream[Verse 1]
Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart
Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart
Touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips
Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you

[Chorus]
Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
I've had my share of love affairs
But they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss

[Post-Chorus]
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

[Verse 2]
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong
Still, it's making me scared that my love is so strong
Losing you is a nightmare, baby, and to me it's new
Never before did you see me begging for more

[Chorus]
Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
I've had my share of love affairs
But they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss

[Post-Chorus]
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

[Outro]
Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
Kisses of fire, burning, burning
(I'm at the point of no returning)
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
I'm riding higher than the sky
And there is fire in every kiss
(Caught in a landslide of emotions)
Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
Kisses of fire, burning, burning...[Verse 1]
People everywhere
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Giving out a spark
Across the room, your eyes are glowing in the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
And here we go again, we know the start, we know the end
Masters of the scene
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
You know what I mean

[Chorus]
Voulez-vous (Ah-ha)
Take it now or leave it (Ah-ha)
Now is all we get (Ah-ha)
Nothing promised, no regrets (Ah-ha)

You know what to do (Ah-ha)
La question c'est "Voulez-vous?"
Voulez-vous

[Verse 2]
I know what you think
"The girl means business, so I'll offer her a drink"
Looking mighty proud
I see you leave your table, pushing through the crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm really glad you came, you know the rules, you know the game
Master of the scene
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
You know what I mean

[Chorus]
Voulez-vous (Ah-ha)
Take it now or leave it (Ah-ha)
Now is all we get (Ah-ha)

Where is the spring and the summer
That once was yours and mine?
Where did it go?
I just don't know
But still, my love for you will live forever

[Chorus]
Hasta Mañana till we meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Mañana, baby
Hasta Mañana, until then

[Verse 2]
Where is the dream we were dreaming
And all the nights we shared?
Where did they go?
I just don't know
And I can't tell you just how much I miss you
[Chorus]
Hasta Mañana till we meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Mañana, baby
Hasta Mañana, until then

[Outro]
Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Mañana, baby
Hasta Mañana, until then[Verse 1]
My, my - at Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender
Oh, yeah - and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

[Pre-Chorus]
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

[Chorus]
Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

[Verse 2]
My, my - I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh, yeah - and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

[Pre-Chorus]
And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

[Chorus]
Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
[Pre-Chorus]
So how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

[Outro]
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
Woo, Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
Woo, Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
