[Intro]
What a drag it is getting old

[Verse 1]
"Kids are different today," I hear every mother say
Mother needs something today to calm her down
And though she's not really ill, there's a little yellow pill

[Refrain]
She goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way, gets her through her busy day

[Verse 2]
"Things are different today", I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for a husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake and she burns a frozen steak

[Refrain]
And goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
And two help her on her way, get her through her busy day

[Chorus]
Doctor, please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old
[Verse 3]
"Men just aren't the same today", I hear every mother say
"They just don't appreciate that you get tired"
"They're so hard to satisfy", you can tranquilize your mind

[Refrain]
So go running for the shelter of your mother's little helper
And four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight

[Chorus]
Doctor, please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

[Verse 4]
"Life's just much too hard today", I hear ev'ry mother say
The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
And if you take more of those, you will get an overdose

[Refrain]
No more running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
They just helped you on your way through your busy dying day

Hey[Verse 1]
You don't know what's going on
You've been away for far too long
You can't come back and think you are still mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

[Chorus]
Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
You are left out
Out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

[Verse 2]
The girl who wants to run away
Discovers that she's had her day
It's no good you're thinking that you are still mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor unfaithful baby
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

[Chorus]
Well baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out
Out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

[Verse 3]
You thought you were a clever girl
Giving up your social whirl
But you can't come back and be the first in line, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
You're obsolete my baby
My poor old-fashioned baby
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

[Chorus]
Well baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out
Out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Sing the song now...

Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

[Verse 4]
You don't know what's going on
You've been away for much too long
But you can't come back and think you are still mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

[Chorus]
Well baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out, yes you are
I said no, out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

[Outro]
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're...[Verse 1]
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Verse 2]
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

[Verse 3]
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

[Verse 4]
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

[Verse 1]
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Bridge]

[Outro]
I wanna see it painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah

[Bridge][Verse 1]
Under my thumb the girl who once had me down
Under my thumb the girl who once pushed me around

[Chorus]
It's down to me
The difference in the clothes she wears
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Ain't it the truth, babe?

[Verse 2]
Under my thumb the squirming dog who's just had her day
Under my thumb a girl who has just changed her ways

[Chorus]
It's down to me, yes it is
The way she does just what she's told
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Ah, ah, say it's alright

[Verse 3]
Under my thumb a Siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb she's the sweetest, hmmm, pet in the world

[Chorus]
It's down to me
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

[Instrumental Break]
Ah, take it easy babe

[Chorus]
It's down to me, oh yeah
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Yeah, it feels alright

[Verse 4]
Under my thumb her eyes are just kept to herself
Under my thumb, well I, I can still look at someone else

[Chorus]
It's down to me, oh that's what I said
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

[Outro]
Say, it's alright
Say it's all...
Say it's all...

Take it easy babe
Take it easy babe
It feels alright
Take it, take it easy, babe[Instrumental Intro]

[Intro]
Watch it!

[Verse 1]
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at the morning drivin' rain

[Chorus]
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

[Verse 2]
I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back

[Chorus]
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

[Verse 3]
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
Yeah, yeah
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head
My, my, yeah
[Chorus]
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

[Outro]
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas[Verse 1]
Take me to the station
And put me on a train
I've got no expectations
To pass through here again

[Verse 2]
Once I was a rich man
Now I am so poor
But never in my sweet short life
Have I felt like this before

[Verse 3]
Your heart is like a diamond
You throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me
You pack my peace of mind

[Verse 4]
Our love was like the water
That splashes on a stone
Our love is like our music
Its here, and then its gone

[Verse 5]
So take me to the airport
And put me on a plane
I got no expectations
To pass through here again[Intro]
Ah... hey
Yeah, cat's own tail

[Verse 1]
I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
I know you're no scared-eyed honey
There'll be a feast if you just come upstairs

[Refrain]
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Verse 2]
I can see that you're fifteen years old
No I don't want your I.D
And I can see that you're so far from home

[Refrain]
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet, bet your mama don't know you scream like that
I bet your mother don't know you can spit like that
[Verse 3]
You look so weird and you're so far from home
Bet you really miss your mother
Don't look so scared I'm no mad-brained bear

[Refrain]
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Woo!
I bet your mama don't know that you scratch like that
I bet she don't know you can bite like that

[Verse 4]
You say you got a friend, that she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs?
If she's so wild then she can join in too

[Refrain]
It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet you mama don't know you can bite like that
I'll bet she never saw you scratch my back[Instrumental Intro]
Huh, huh, huh

[Verse 1]
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 2]
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game
[Verse 3]
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, "Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

Oh yeah, get down heavy!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Variation]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game

[Verse 4]
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Instrumental outro with scatting and ad-lib vocals][Intro]
My-My-My-My

[Verse 1]
Don't you worry about what's on your mind, oh my
I'm in no hurry, I can take my time, oh my
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tied (tongue's getting tied)
I'm off my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm high, but I try, try, try, oh my

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
My-my-my-my, oh my

[Verse 2]
I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
(Let's spend the night together)
But I just can't apologize, oh no
(Let's spend the night together)
Don't hang me up and don't let me down (don't let me down)
We could have fun just groovin' around, 'round and 'round
And oh my, my

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together

[Interlude]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever

[Bridge]
You know I'm smiling, baby
You need some guiding, baby
I'm just deciding, baby; now
I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Let's spend the night together now
Oh m-my-my-my-my-my-my

[Verse 3]
This doesn't happen to me every day, oh my
(Let's spend the night together)
No excuses offered anyway, oh my
(Let's spend the night together)
I'll satisfy your every need (your every need)
And now I know you will satisfy me
Oh m-my-my-my-my-my

[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

[Outro]
Oh m-my-my-my-my-my-my
(Let's spend the night together)
Now I need you, need you more than ever, woman
(Let's spend the night together)
I'll satisfy your every need, woman
(Let's spend the night together)
Now I know, I know you'll satisfy me, whoa, my-my
(Let's spend the night together)
I beg you, baby, oh my-my-my-my-my-my
(Let's spend the night together)
A-come on, now, oh baby, my-my-my-my
(Let's spend the night together)[Verse 1]
She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes

[Chorus]
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

[Verse 2]
Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost

[Chorus]
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

[Verse 3]
"There's no time to lose," I heard her say
"Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and you
Will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?"

[Chorus]
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you[Verse 1]
Yeah, I’m a dealin' man, still dealing, yeah
I’ll go keep on dealing 'til I find myself a bed
I got to stop dealing, I believe I’ll ride ‘em on down
Well, I done stopped dealing, I believe I’ll ride 'em on down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, raised in the country, got up raised in town
Got two kids and they’re all look like mine
I got to stop dealing, I believe I’ll ride ‘em on down
Yeah, I got to stop dealing, I believe I’ll ride 'em on down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I’m dealing darling, bottom of the deck
Seem like somebody gonna take my shit
Well, I got to stop dealing, I believe I’ll ride ‘em on down
Well, I done stopped dealing, I believe I’ll ride 'em on down
Yeah

[Verse 4]
Hey, born yesterday, yeah, and not a day before
Here you come knocking at my door
Done stop dealing, I believe I’ll ride ‘em on down
Yeah, I done stopped dealing, I believe I’ll ride 'em on down
Yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, I done stopped dealing, I believe I’ll ride 'em on down
That was good[Verse 1]
I live on an apartment
On the ninety-ninth floor of my block
And I sit at home looking out the window
Imagining the world has stopped
Then in flies a guy
Who's all dressed up just like the Union Jack
And says, I've won five pounds
If I have his kind of detergent pack

[Chorus]
I said, "Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby"

[Verse 2]
The telephone is ringing
I say, "Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?"
A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you?"
Well, I guess I'm doing fine
It's three a.m., there's too much noise
Don't you people ever want to go to bed
Because you feel so good
Do you have to drive me out of my head

[Chorus]
I said, "Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby"

[Verse 3]
I was sick and tired, fed up with this
And decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody, not a soul around
I laid myself out
I was so tired and I started to dream
In the morning the parking tickets were just like a flag
Stuck on my windscreen

[Chorus]
I said, "Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around cause two's a crowd
On my cloud baby"

[Outro]
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Hey, you, get off of my cloud
Don't hang around, baby two's a crowd
On my cloud[Chorus]
It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see
But not for me
I sit and watch
As tears go by

[Verse]
My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing
All I hear is the sound
Of rain falling on the ground
I sit and watch
As tears go by

[Chorus]
It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Doing things I used to do
They think are new
I sit and watch
As tears go by[Verse 1]
Is there nothing I can say? Nothing I can do?
Change your mind, I'm so in love with you
Too deep in, you can't get out
You're just a poor girl in a rich man's house
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, baby, I'm crying over you

[Verse 2]
Don't you know promises were never meant to keep?
Just like the night, dissolve off in sleep
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
Yeah, the other night, crying
Crying, baby, yeah, yeah, I'm crying
Yeah, I'm like a child, baby
I'm like a child, baby
Like a child
Yes, I'm like a child, like a child, like a child, like a child (Woo)
[Verse 4]
You think you're one of a special breed
You think that you're his pet Pekingese
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 5]
Yeah, I was dreaming last night, babe
Last night, I was dreaming
How you'd be mine, but I was crying
Like a child, yeah, I was crying
Crying like a child
You will be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, all mine
You could be mine, could be mine
Could be mine, all mine

[Verse 6]
I come to you, so silent in the night
So stealthy, so animal quiet
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Yeah, you should be mine, mine, oh
[Verse 7]
Yes, you could be mine
Tonight and every night
I will be your knight in shining armor
Coming to your emotional rescue

[Outro]
You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine
You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine
I will be your knight in shining armor
Riding across the desert on a fine Arab charger
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh[Verse]
Who's that woman on your arm all dressed up to do you harm
And I'm hip to what she'll do, give her just about a month or two
Bit off more than I can chew and I knew what it was leading to
Some things, well, I can't refuse
One of them, one of them the bedroom blues
She delivers right on time, I can't resist a corny line
But take the shine right off you shoes
Carrying, carrying the bedroom blues
In the bar you're getting drunk, I ain’t in love, I ain’t in luck
Hide the switch and shut the light, let it all come down tonight
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
Your face I'll never see no more
Let it all come down tonight
Keep those tears hid out of sight, let it loose, let it all come down[Verse 1]
I'm the man on the mountain, come on up
I'm the plowman in the valley with a face full of mud
Yes, I'm fumbling and I know my car don't start
Yes, I'm stumbling and I know I play a bad guitar

[Chorus]
Give me little drink from your loving cup
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk

[Verse 2]
I'm the man who walks the hillside in the sweet summer sun
I'm the man that brings you roses when you ain't got none
Well I can run and jump and fish, but I won't fight
You if you want to push and pull with me all night

[Chorus]
Give me little drink from you loving cup
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk

[Bridge]
I feel so humble with you tonight
Just sitting in front of the fire
See your face dancing in the flame
Feel your mouth kissing me again
What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz
What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz
Oh, what a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz

[Verse 3]
Yes, I am nitty gritty and my shirt's all torn
But I would love to spill the beans with you till dawn

[Chorus]
Give me little drink from your loving cup
Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I hear you talking when I'm on the street
Your mouth don't move, but I can hear you speak
What's the matter with the boy?
He don't come around no more
Is he checking out for sure?
Is he gonna close the door on me?
And I'm always hearing voices on the street
I want to shout, but I can hardly speak
I was making love last night to a dancer friend of mine
I can't seem to stay in step
Because she come every time that she pirouettes over me

[Chorus]
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)

[Verse 2]
I'm zipping through the days at lightning speed
Plug in, flush out and fire the fucking feed
[Pre-Chorus]
Heading for the overload
Splattered on the nasty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

[Chorus]
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)

[Bridge]
Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene, oh
It's all mesmerized, all that inside me, oh

[Verse 3]
The sunshine bores the daylights out of me
Chasing shadows, moonlight mystery

[Pre-Chorus]
Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more
[Chorus]
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
And I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)
And I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
(Only get them off, get them off, only get them off)[Verse 1]
Saw you stretched out in Room Ten Oh Nine
With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye
Oh, couldn't see to get a line on you, my sweet honey love
Berber jewelry jangling down the street
Making bloodshot eyes at every woman that you meet
Could not seem to get a high on you, my sweet honey love

[Chorus]
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun

[Verse 2]
When you're drunk in the alley, baby, with your clothes all torn
And your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn
Just seemed too many flies on you, I just can't brush them off
Angels beating all their wings in time
With smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes
Whoa, thought I heard one sigh for you
Come on up, come on up now, come on up now

[Chorus]
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song you sing your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun[Verse 1]
Wading through the waste, stormy winter
And there's not a friend to help you through
Trying to stop the waves behind your eyeballs
Drop your reds, drop your greens and blues

Thank you for your wine, California
Thank you for your sweet and bitter fruits
Yes I've got the desert in my toenail
And I hid the speed inside my shoe

[Chorus]
But come on, come on down, Sweet Virginia
Come on, honey child, I beg of you
Come on, come on down, you've got it in ya
You've got to scrape that shit right off you shoes

[Saxophone Solo]
I want you to come on and sing it with me one time...
All right

[Chorus]
Yes, I want you to come on, come on down, Sweet Virginia
I said I want you to come on, honey child, I beg of you
I want you come on, honey child you've got it in you
You've got to scrape that shit right off you shoes

One more time
Hey

[Chorus]
But come on, come on down Sweet Virginia
Come on, come on down, I beg of you
Come on, come on down, you've got it in ya
You've got to scrape that shit right off you shoes[Verse 1]
Angie, Angie
When will those clouds all disappear?
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful, yeah
But ain't it time we said goodbye?
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried?
All the dreams we held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?

[Verse 2]
Oh, Angie, don't you weep
All your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye? Yeah

[Verse 3]
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say were satisfied
But Angie, I still love you, baby
Everywhere I look, I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on, baby, dry your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it good to be alive?
Angie, Angie
They can't say we never tried[Verse 1]
You're the kind of person
You meet at certain dismal dull affairs
Center of a crowd, talking much too loud
Running up and down the stairs
Well, it seems to me that you have seen too much in too few years
And though you've tried you just can't hide
Your eyes are edged with tears

[Chorus 1]
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

[Verse 2]
When you were a child
You were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax

[Chorus 1]
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

[Chorus 2]
Oh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane
Well nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse. Oh please

[Verse 3]
You were still in school
When you had that fool
Who really messed your mind
And after that you turned your back
On treating people kind
On our first trip
I tried so hard to rearrange your mind
But after while I realized you were disarranging mine

[Chorus 1]
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

[Chorus 2]
Oh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane
Well nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse. Oh please

When you were a child
You were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax
You better stop
Look around

[Outro]
Here comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown[Verse 1]
I had a dream last night I was piloting a plane
And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Shot up a horde of zombies, but I come out on top

[Pre-Chorus]
What's it all about?
Guess it just reflects my mood
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

[Chorus]
When all I hear is doom and gloom
With all this darkness in my room
Through that light, your face, I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?

[Verse 2]
We lost all that treasure in an overseas war
Just goes to show you don't get what you paid for
Bowing to the rich and you worry 'bout the poor
Put my feet up on the couch and lock all the doors

[Pre-Chorus]
What's that funky noise?
It's the tightening of their screws
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt
[Chorus]
All I hear is doom and gloom
But when those drums go
Boom, boom, boom
Through that night, your face, I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?
Yeah, baby, won't you dance with me?
Ah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Fracking deep for oil
But there's nothing in the sump
There's kids all picking at the garbage dump
I'm running out of water, so I better prime the pump
I'm trying to stay sober, but I end up drunk

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll be eating dirt
Living on the side of the road
There's some food for thought
Gonna make your head explode
Feeling kind of hurt, yeah

[Chorus]
But all I hear is doom and gloom
With all this darkness in my room
Through that night, your face I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?
[Outro]
Yeah, come on
Baby won't you dance with me?
I'm feeling kind of hurt
Baby, won't you dance with me?
Oh yeah, sitting in the dirt
Baby, won't you dance with me?[Intro: Merry Clayton]
Oooooh
Oooooh

[Verse 1: Mick Jagger]
Ooh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

[Chorus: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

[Verse 2: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
Ooh, see the fire is sweeping
Our very street today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost your way

[Chorus: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

[Verse 3: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
Mmm, the floods is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm going to fade away

[Chorus - Variation: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

[Outro: Mick Jagger and Merry Clayton]
I tell you love, sister
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, (kiss away kiss away)

[Guitar Solo][Chorus]
Well, we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, you can lean on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, you can lean on me

[Verse 1]
She said, "My breasts, they will always be open
Baby, you can rest your weary head right on me
And there will always be a space in my parking lot
When you need a little coke and sympathy"

[Chorus]
Yeah, we all need someone we can dream on
And if you want it, baby, well you can dream on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can cream on
And if you want to, well you can cream on me

[Verse 2]
I was dreaming of a steel guitar engagement
When you drunk my health in scented jasmine tea
But you knifed me in my dirty, filthy basement
With that jaded, faded, junky nurse - oh what pleasant company

[Chorus]
Come on, we all need someone we can feed on
Yeah, and if you want it, well you can feed on me
Hey, take my arm, take my leg
Oh baby, don't you take my head

[Chorus]
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, and if you want it, baby, well you can bleed on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, and if you want it, baby, why don't you bleed on me (All over, woo!)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
(Come on, babe)
Ah, get it on rider, woo, get it on rider, get it on rider
You can bleed all over me, yeah
Get it on rider, woo, get it on rider, yeah
You can be my rider, you can come all over me, oh
Get it on rider, babe, get it on rider, get it on rider
You can come all over me{​Intro}​

[Verse 1]
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Everybody got to go
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
The one that shut the kitchen door
He don't give a hoot of warning
Wrapped up in a black cat cloak
He don't go in the light of the morning
He split the time the cock'rel crows

[Verse 2]
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
Did you see him jump the garden wall
Sighin' down the wind so sad
Listen and you'll hear him moan
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
Everybody got to go

{​Bridge}​

[Verse 3]
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show
Well, I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
Yeah, the one you never seen before

{​Bridge}​

Oh don't do that, oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Oh don't do that, oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that
Don't you do that, don't you do that

{​Bridge}​

[Verse 4]
Well, you heard about the Boston…
It’s not one of those…
Well, talkin' 'bout the midnight...sh...
The one that closed the bedroom door
I'm called the hit-and-run raper in anger
The knife-sharpened tippie-toe...
Or just the shoot 'em dead, brainbell jangler
You know, the one you never seen before

[Verse 5]
So if you ever meet the midnight rambler
Coming down your marble hall
Well he's pouncing like proud black panther
Well, you can say I, I told you so
Well, don't you listen for the midnight rambler, yeah
Play it easy, as you go
I'm gonna smash down all your plate glass windows
Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door

{​Bridge}​

[Verse 6]
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
He'll leave his footprints up and down your hall
And did you hear about the midnight gambler
And did you see me make my midnight call
And if you ever catch the midnight rambler
I'll steal your mistress from under your nose
I'll go easy with your cold fanged anger
I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby
And it hurts![Verse 1]
I'm a fleabit peanut monkey
All my friends are junkies
That's not really true

I'm a cold Italian pizza
I could use a lemon squeezer
You could do?

Well, I've been bit and I've been tossed around
By every she-rat in this town
Have you, babe?

[Refrain]
Well, I am just a monkey man
I'm glad you are a monkey woman too

[Verse 2]
I was bitten by a boar
I was gouged and I was gored
But I pulled on through

Yes, I'm a sack of broken eggs
I always have an unmade bed
Don't you?
Well, I hope we're not too messianic
Or a trifle too satanic
We love to play the blues

[Refrain]
Well I am just a monkey man
I'm glad you are a monkey, monkey woman
Monkey woman too, babe!

[Outro]
I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey!
I'm a monkey man!  I'm a monkey man!
I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey! I'm a monkey!
Monkey! Monkey! Monkey![Intro: London Bach Choir]
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man
No, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime
You'll find
You get what you need

[Verse 1]
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you  might find
You get what you need
[Verse 2]
And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't, we're going to blow a 50-amp fuse"
Sing it to me

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you just might find
You get what you need

[Verse 3]
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "death"
I said to him:
[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you just might find
You get what you need
You get what you need, yeah, oh baby

[Verse 4]
I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands
Sing it to me

[Outro]
You can't always get what you want, yeah
You can't always get what you want, ooh yeah
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you just might find
You just might find you get what you need, ah yeah
Ah yeah
Wooh!
Ah you can't always get what you want (no no)
You can't always get what you want (you can't no no)
You can't always get what you want
...mmm but if you try sometimes, you just might find
You just might find you get what you need
Ah yeah!
Ah yeah! Yeah[Verse 1]
Well I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Yeah, I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Whoa, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
When all your love's in vain

[Verse 2]
When the train come in the station
I looked her in the eye
Well the train come in the station
And I looked her in the eye
Whoa, I felt so sad so lonesome
That I could not help but cry

[Verse 3]
When the train left the station
It had two lights on behind
Yeah, when the train left the station
It had two lights on behind
Whoa, the blue light was my baby
And the red light was my mind

[Outro]
All my love was in vain
All my love's in vainnull[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Verse 1]
When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!

[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Verse 2]
When I'm watching my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say
[Chorus]
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Verse 3]
When I'm riding round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me baby, better come back, maybe next week
'Cause you see, I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, oh no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!
I can't get no (x3)
I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction (x3)
I can't get no[Verse 1]
Well, you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes
And the chauffeur drives your car
You let everybody know
But don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire
Your mother she's an heiress, owns a block in Saint John's Wood
And your father'd be there with her
If he only could
But don't play with me, because you're playing with fire
Your old man took her diamond's and tiaras by the score
Now she gets her kicks in Stepney
Not in Knightsbridge anymore
So don't play with me, because you're playing with fire
Now you've got some diamonds and you will have some others
But you'd better watch your step, girl
Or start living with your mother
So don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire
So don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'll never be your beast of burden
My back is broad, but it's a-hurting
All I want, for you to make love to me
I'll never be your beast of burden
I've walked for miles, my feet are hurting
All I want is for you to make love to me

[Chorus]
Am I hard enough?
Am I rough enough?
Am I rich enough?
I'm not too blind to see

[Verse 2]
I'll never be your beast of burden
So let's go home and draw the curtains
Music on the radio
Come on, baby, make sweet love to me

[Chorus]
Am I hard enough?
Am I rough enough?
Am I rich enough?
I'm not too blind to see
[Bridge]
Oh, little sister
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girls
You're a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Pretty, pretty, such a pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Come on, baby, please, please, please

[Verse 3]
I'll tell you, you can put me out on the street
Put me out with no shoes on my feet
But put me out, put me out
Put me out of misery, yeah
All your sickness, I can suck it up
Throw it all at me, I can shrug it off
There's one thing, baby, I don't understand
You keep on telling me I ain't your kind of man

[Chorus]
Ain't I rough enough? Ooh, honey
Ain't I tough enough?
Ain't I rich enough? In love enough?
Ooh, please

[Outro]
I'll never be your beast of burden
I'll never be your beast of burden
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never be
I'll never be your beast of burden
I've walked for miles, my feet are hurting
All I want is you to make love to me, yeah
I don't need no beast of burden
I need no fussing, I need no nursing
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never be[Produced by The Glimmer Twins]

[Verse 1]
I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone

I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you sometime

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you, child
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter, man?
We're goingna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls thats just dying to meet you
We're goinna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around

Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 3]
Oh, everybody waits so long
Oh, baby, why you waitin' so long?
Won't you come on, come on?
I've been walkin' Central Park, singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet, shuffling through the street
Asking people, "What's the matter with you, boy?"
Sometimes, I want to say to, to myself
Sometimes I say

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, I won't miss you child

[Verse 4]
I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord, I won't miss you, child
You've just been blotting out my mind
Fooling on my time
No, I won't miss you, baby, yeah

Here I lie in my hospital bed
Tell me, Sister Morphine, when are you coming round again?
Oh, I don't think I can wait that long
Oh, you see that I'm not that strong

[Verse 2]
The scream of the ambulance is sounding in my ears
Tell me, Sister Morphine, how long have I been lying here?

[Bridge]
What am I doing in this place?
Why does the doctor have no face?
Oh, I can't crawl across the floor
Ah, can't you see, Sister Morphine, I'm trying to score

[Verse 3]
Well it just goes to show
Things are not what they seem
Please, Sister Morphine, turn my nightmares into dreams
Oh, can't you see I'm fading fast?
And that this shot will be my last

[Verse 4]
Sweet Cousin Cocaine, lay your cool cool hand on my head
Ah, come on, Sister Morphine, you better make up my bed
Because you know, and I know, in the morning I'll be dead
Yeah, and you can sit around, yeah and you can watch all the
Clean white sheets stained red
Hey

Yeah[Verse 1]
I'm feeling so tired, can't understand it
Just had a fortnight's sleep
I'm feeling so stuffed, I'm so distracted
Ain't touched a thing all week
I'm feeling drunk, juiced up and sloppy
Ain't touched a drink all night
I'm feeling hungry, can't see the reason
Just had a horse meat pie

[Chorus]
Yeah when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah when you lay me out
My heart is beating louder than a big bass drum, alright

It must be love, it's a bitch
Yeah, you got to mix it, child, you got to fix
It must be love, it's a bitch, alright

Sometimes, I'm sexy, move like a stud
Like kicking the stall all night
Sometimes, I'm so shy, got to be worked on
Don't have no bark or bite, alright

I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah, when you lay me out
My heart is bumping louder than a big bass drum, alright

Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
Sold in the market down in New Orleans
Scarred old slaver knows he's doing alright
Hear him whip the women just around midnight

[Chorus]
Brown sugar, how come you taste so good? Uh huh
Brown sugar, just like a young girl should, uh huh, oh (Woo)

Hear me singing soft and low

Hear me howlin'
(And all, all around your street now)
Hear me knockin'
(And all, all around your town)[Verse 1]
Well, when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair
Talking to some rich folk that you know
Well, I hope you won't see me in my ragged company
Well, you know I could never be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground

[Chorus]
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

[Verse 2]
Well, when you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day
Ah, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
And another girl can take my pain away

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
[Chorus]
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
Hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground

[Chorus]
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the U.S. Mail
Say it with dead flowers at my wedding
And I won’t forget to put roses on your grave
No, I won’t forget to put roses on your grave[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When the wind blows and the rain feels cold
With a head full of snow, with a head full of snow
In the window, there’s a face you know
Don’t the night pass slow? Don’t the nights pass slow?

[Chorus]
The sound of strangers sending nothing to my mind
Just another mad, mad day on the road
I am just living to be lying by your side
But I’m just about a moonlight mile on down the road

[Verse 2]
Made a rag pile of my shiny clothes
Going to warm my bones, going to warm my bones
I’ve got silence on my radio
Let the air waves flow, let the air waves flow

[Chorus]
For I am sleeping under strange, strange skies
Just another mad, mad day on the road
My dreams is fading down the railway line
I’m just about a moonlight mile on down the road
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
I’m hiding, sister, and I’m dreaming
I’m riding down your moonlight mile
I’m hiding, baby, but I’m dreaming
I’m riding down your moonlight mile
I’m riding down your moonlight mile

Let it go now
Come on up, baby
Yeah, let it go now
Yeah
Flow now, baby
Yeah, come on now, yeah

Hey

[Outro]
Yeah I’m coming home
Cause I’m just about a moonlight mile on down the road
On down the road, on down the road
Yeah, yeah baby

[Instrumental interlude][Verse 1]
Did you ever wake up to find
A day that broke up your mind
Destroyed your notion of circular time

[Chorus]
It's just that demon life has got you in its sway
It's just that demon life has got you in its sway

[Verse 2]
Ain't flinging tears out on the dusty ground
For all my friends out on the burial ground
Can't stand the feeling getting so brought down

[Chorus]
It's just that evil life that got me in its sway
It's just that evil life that got me in its sway

[Bridge]
There must be ways to find out
Love is the way they say is really strutting out

[Verse 3]
Hey, hey, hey now
One day I woke up to find
Right in the bed next to mine
Someone that broke me up with a corner of her smile, yeah
[Chorus]
It's just that demon life that got me in its sway
It's just that demon life that got me in its sway

[Outro]
It's just that demon life has got me[Verse 1]
Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted, I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

[Verse 2]
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

[Verse 3]
I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die

[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day

[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some dayThe smell of you baby, my senses, my senses be praised
The smell of you baby, my senses, my senses be praised

Kissing and running, kissing and running away
Kissing and running, kissing and running away
Senses be praised
Senses be praised

You're my saving grace, saving grace
Nothing will harm you
Nothing will stand in your way
Nothing, nothing
Nothing will stop you
And nothing will stand in your way

No one will harm you
No one will stand in your way
No one will bar you
Nothing will stand in your way
Nothing
There's nothing[Intro]
If you start me up
If you start me up, I'll never stop
If you can start me up
If you can start me up, I'll never stop

[Verse 1]
I've been running hot
You got me ticking, going to blow my top
If you start me up
If you start me up, I'll never stop
Never stop, never stop, never stop

[Chorus]
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Spread out the oil, the gasoline
I walk smooth, ride in a mean, mean machine

[Verse 2]
Start it up
If you start me up
Kick on the starter, give it all you got
You got to, you got to
I can't compete with the riders in the other heats
If you rough it up
If you like it you can slide it up
Slide it up, slide it up, slide it up

[Chorus]
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy, she's a mean, mean machine

[Verse 3]
Start it up
Start me up
Ah, ah, give it all you've got
You've got to never, never, never stop
Start it up, whoo!
Ah don't trip me up, just start it up

Never, never, never

[Chorus]
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen
Hey, hey

[Bridge]
If you start it up
Love the day and we will never stop, never stop
Never, never, never stop
Start me up
Never stop, never stop

[Chorus]
You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man cum
You, you make a dead man cum{Intro}

[Verse 1]
Watching girls go passing by
It ain't the latest thing
I'm just standing in a doorway
I'm just trying to make some sense'
Out of these girls that passing by
The tales they tell of men
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend

[Verse 2]
A smile relieves a heart that grieves
Remember what I said
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend

{Bridge}

[Verse 3]
Don't need a whore, I don't need no booze
Don't need a virgin priest
But I need someone I can cry to
I need someone to protect
Making love and breaking hearts
It is a game for youth
But I'm not waiting on my lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
[Outro]
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
Waiting on a friend
Waiting on a friend{​Instrumental Hook}​

[Chorus]
She comes in colours everywhere;
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

[Chorus]
She comes in colours everywhere;
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

{​Instrumental}​

[Verse 1]
Have you seen her dressed in blue
See the sky in front of you
And her face is like a sail
Speck of white so fair and pale
Have you seen a lady fairer
[Chorus]
She comes in colours everywhere;
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

[Verse 2]
Have you seen her all in gold
Like a queen in days of old
She shoots colours all around
Like a sunset going down
Have you seen a lady fairer

[Chorus]
She comes in colours everywhere;
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

{​Instrumental}​

[Outro]
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours[Verse 1]
I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
Cause I just can't seem to drink it off my mind

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

[Verse 2]
I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me with roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

[Verse 3]
Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris
Naked as the day that I will die
The sailors, they're so charming there in Paris
But I just don't seem to sail you off my mind

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
