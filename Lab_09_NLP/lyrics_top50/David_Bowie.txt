[Intro]

[Verse 1]
A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers
And ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie
Woo-hoo

(Get back one)

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, oh

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie
[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoa-oh

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved

[Bridge]
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo

[Chorus]
Oh, the Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, oh
Go
Go
[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, oh
Go
Go, go

[Instrumental Outro][Intro]

[Verse 1]
Time - He's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, Boy
Time - He flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, Boy
Time - In Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain
Regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it says 9:25 and I think
"Oh God! I'm still alive."

[Chorus]
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li
[Verse 2]
You - Are not a victim
You - Just scream with boredom!
You - Are not evicting time...
[Bowie breathing heavily]
Chimes - Goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard
But keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind
But love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real and dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I have to give
Is guilt for dreaming

[Chorus]
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li

[Verse 1]
Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
‘Tis my curse, I suppose
That was patrol
That was patrol
This is the war

[​Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Black struck the kiss, she kept my cock
Smote the mistress, drifting on
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
She stole my purse, with rattling speed
That was patrol
This is the war
‘Tis a pity she was a whore

[Bridge 2]​​

[Verse 3]
Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
‘Tis my fate, I suppose
For, that was patrol
That was patrol
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
[Outro]
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
Woo!
Ahh! Woo!
Woo![Intro]
In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
In the centre of it all, in the centre of it all
Your eyes
On the day of execution, on the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes
​
[Bridge I]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes
Ah-ah-ah

[​Bridge II]
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)
How many times does an angel fall?
How many people lie instead of talking tall?
He trod on sacred ground, he cried loud into the crowd
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangstar)
​
I can't answer why (I'm a blackstar)
Just go with me (I'm not a filmstar)
I'ma take you home (I'm a blackstar)
Take your passport and shoes (I'm not a popstar)
And your sedatives, boo (I'm a blackstar)
You're a flash in the pan (I'm not a marvel star)
I'm the Great I Am (I'm a blackstar)
​
I'm a blackstar, way up, on money, I've got game
I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
I want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre then stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a star's star, I'm a blackstar)
I can't answer why (I'm not a gangstar)
But I can tell you how (I'm not a flam star)
We were born upside-down (I'm a star's star)
Born the wrong way 'round (I’m not a white star)
I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangstar
I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar
I'm not a pornstar, I'm not a wandering star
I'm a blackstar, I’m a blackstar

[Bridge III]​
In the villa of Ormen stands a solitary candle
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes
On the day of execution, only women kneel and smile
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes, your eyes
Ah-ah-ah

[Outro][​​​Intro]

[Verse 1]
Look up here, I'm in heaven
I've got scars that can't be seen
I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now

[Verse 2]
Look up here, man, I'm in danger
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high, it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me?

[Bridge]
By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass

[Verse 3]
This way or no way
You know I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Now, ain't that just like me?
Oh, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Oh, I'll be free
Ain't that just like me?

[Outro][Verse 1]
Cash girls suffer me, I’ve got no enemies
I’m walking down
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see
If I'll never see the English evergreens I’m running to
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see

[Chorus 1]
I’m dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I’m trying to
We bitches tear our magazines
Those oligarchs with foaming mouths come
Now and then
Can’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you
I’m trying to
I’m dying to

[Verse 2]
Dollar days, survival sex
Honour stretching tails to necks
I’m falling down
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see
If I'll never see the English evergreens I’m running to
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see
[Chorus 2]
I’m dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I’m trying to
It’s all gone wrong but on and on
The bitter nerve ends never end
I’m falling down
Don’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you
I’m trying to
I’m dying to

[Outro]
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to[Verse 1]

[Verse 1]
I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

[Chorus]
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

[Verse 2]
Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
That's the message that I sent

[Chorus]
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

[Chorus]
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away[Refrain]

Don't let me hear you say
Life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come get up, my baby)

[Chorus 1]
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come get up, my baby)

[Chorus 2]
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

[Verse 3]
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
(Come get up, my baby)
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day
I believe, oh Lord, I believe all the way
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

[Chorus 1]
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
[Verse 3]
Though I'm past 100,000 miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you-

[Chorus]
-Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental outro][Spoken Intro]
This ain't rock 'n' roll, this is genocide!

[Verse 1]
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's Freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal

[Chorus]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Verse 2]
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzan, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are stabilised
[Chorus]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Bridge]
(Oo-oo-ooh) call them the Diamond Dogs
(Oo-oo-ooh) call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh, hoo!
Ah ooh!

[Verse 3]
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

[Chorus]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
[Outro]
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs!
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooh hoo!
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool, Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
(Beware of the Diamond Dogs)
(Beware of the Diamond Dogs)
(Beware of the Diamond Dogs)

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

[Pre-Chorus]
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

[Chorus]
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess

We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

[Bridge]

[Outro]
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chi, chi-chi
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooh, your face is a mess
Ooh, ooh, so how could they know?
Ah, ah, how could they know?
Ah, ah[Verse 1]
It's safe in the city
To love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me
Putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the centre of things
Where the knowing one says:

[Chorus]
"Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
For hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing"

[Verse 2]
I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads of Hamburgers, and

[Chorus]
"Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
For hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing"[Verse 1]

No one needs anyone, they don't even just pretend
Johnny's in America

[Chorus]
I'm afraid of Americans

Johnny wants a woman, Johnny wants to think of a joke

God is an American

God is an AmericanMmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for

Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two

Puts people on streets

Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da - that's okay

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'

Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay

Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap

People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da

It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'

Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn

Why - why - why?

Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (people on streets) edge of the night
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

[Verse 1]
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

[Refrain]
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What d'you say?

[Verse 2]
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

[Refrain]
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes, just for one day
[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

[Verse 3]
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

[Refrain]
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes

[Outro]
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day[Verse 1]
Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

[Chorus]
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

[Verse 2]
Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint
And he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

[Chorus]
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all[Verse 1]
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Verse 2]
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
Because Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But the film is a saddening bore
Because I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?[Verse 1]
Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

[Verse 2]
What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

[Chorus]
Oh, you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Oh, you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
[Verse 3]
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race
The earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

[Chorus]
Oh, you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane
Oh, you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
Gotta make way for the Homo Superior[Verse 1]
I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low
'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart, walk out of her mind
Oh, not her

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Verse 2]
She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it then she can do it
She don't make false claims
But she's a Queen and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
Yes, she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
[Refrain]
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Verse 3]
So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh, the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah, I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
And he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all

[Refrain]
It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say
Why didn't I say, no, no, no
[Chorus]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

[Outro]
Ooh, you bet ya!
Oh yeah
Uh-huh
Mmm[Verse 1]
I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality

I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No I ain't got the power anymore

[Verse 2]
I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets
Divine symmetry

Should I kiss the viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore
[Chorus]
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah!
Ah!

[Verse 3]
I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith

If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it
On the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

[Chorus]
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah!
Ah!
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah!
Ah![Intro]
Oh yeah
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Interlude]
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through
[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Outro]
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time[Verse 1]
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long

[Verse 2]
Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name?
And you've been so long

[Chorus]
And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline

[Verse 3]
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

[Verse 4]
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
And it's been so long
[Chorus]
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline

[Verse 5]
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through​
You've been so long
Well, it's been so long

[Chorus]
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out fire
With gasoline

[Outro]
(Been so long)
(Been so long) and it's been so long
(Been so long) I've been putting out fire
(Been so long) it's been so long
(Been so long) been putting out fire
(Been so long) it's been so long
(Been so long) putting out fire
(Been so long)
Been so long (so long, so long)
Been so long (so long, so long)
Been putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
Been putting out fire (been so long, so long, so long)
Been so long
(Been so long, so long, so long)
(Been so long, so long so long)
Been putting out fire
Been putting out fire
Been so long
Been so long
And I've been putting out fire
I've been putting out fire[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl

[Verse 1]
I could escape this feeling with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my little China Girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw the stars crashing

[Verse 2]
I'm a mess without my little China Girl
Wake up in the mornings, where's my little China Girl?
I hear her hearts beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down

[Chorus 1]
I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl

[Verse 3]
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head, plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes

[Bridge]
My little china girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

[Chorus 2]
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
She says... shh
She says... shh
She says...

[Chorus 2]
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
She says... shh
She says...

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

[Verse 1]
(Let's dance) put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance) to the song they're playing on the radio
(Let's sway) while colour lights up your face
(Let's sway) sway through the crowd to an empty space

[Chorus]
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower

[Refrain]
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

[Verse 2]
(Let's dance) for fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance) for fear tonight is all
(Let's sway) you could look into my eyes
(Let's sway) under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

[Chorus]
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower

I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done

[Verse 1]
I catch the paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try

[Verse 2]
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try

[Chorus]
Never going to fall for
(Modern Love) walks beside me
(Modern Love) walks on by
(Modern Love) gets me to the church on time
(Church on Time) terrifies me
(Church on Time) makes me party
(Church on Time) puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man) no confessions
(God and Man) no religion
(God and Man) don't believe in Modern Love

[Verse 3]
It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye
But I try
I try

[Chorus]
Never going to fall for
(Modern Love) walks beside me
(Modern Love) walks on by
(Modern Love) gets me to the church on time
(Church on Time) terrifies me
(Church on Time) makes me party
(Church on Time) puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man) no confessions
(God and Man) no religion
(God and Man) don't believe in Modern Love

(Modern Love) walks beside me
(Modern Love) walks on by
(Modern Love) gets me to the church on time
(Church on time) terrifies me

Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love
(Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love)
Modern love, walks beside me (modern love)
Modern love, walks on by (modern love)
Modern love, walks beside me (modern love)
Modern love, walks on by (modern love)
Never gonna fall for
(Modern love, modern love, modern love, modern love)[Chorus]
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?

[Verse]
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to read, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

[Chorus]
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?[Verse 1]
Sue
I got the job
We'll buy the house
You'll need to rest
But now we'll make it

[Verse 2]
Sue
The clinic called
The x-ray's fine
I brought you home
I just said home

[Verse 3]
Sue, you said you want it writ
Sue, the virgin on your stone
For your grave
Why too dark to speak the words?
For, I know that you have a son
Oh, folly, Sue

[Verse 4]
Ride the train, I'm far from home
In a season of crime none need atone
I kissed your face
Sue, I've pushed you down beneath the weeds
Endless faith in hopeless deeds
I kissed your face
I touched your face

[Bridge]
Sue, goodbye

[Outro]
Sue, I found your note
That you wrote last night
It can't be right
You went with him
Sue, I never dreamed
I'm such a fool
Right from the start
You went with that clown[Verse 1]
Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed to love
Sordid details following"
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but this planet is glowing

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junky
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

[Verse 2]
Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light, but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, whoa whoa
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

[Outro]
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom[Verse 1]
She had an horror of rooms, she was tired, you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes, they were blue but nobody home
Well, she could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do
And she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again

[Pre-Chorus]
She began to wail jealousy's scream
Waiting at the lights, know what I mean

[Chorus]
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

[Verse 2]
She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well, I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies

[Pre-Chorus]
She wails Jimmy's guitar sound, jealousy's scream
Waiting at the lights, know what I mean

[Chorus]
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

[Chorus]
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared[Intro]

[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes

[Verse 1]
Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff, from where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean
Lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no color
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are you, drive like a demon
From station to station

[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains
[Verse 2]
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh, what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love?
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is near

[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

[Verse 5]
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is near

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here

[Verse 5]
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes, "I thought you died alone
A long long time ago"

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world[Verse 1]
It's the darkest hour, you're 22
The voice of youth, the hour of dread
It's the darkest hour, and your voice is new
Love is lost, lost is love

[Verse 2]
Your country's new, your friends are new
Your house, and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new, and your accent, too
But your fear is as old as the world

[Chorus]
Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good, when love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello, you're a beautiful girl

[Verse 3]
Say hello to the lunatic men
Tell them your secrets, they're like the grave
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?
Love is lost, lost is love
You know so much, it’s making you cry
You refuse to talk, but you think like mad
You've cut out your soul and the face of thought
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?[Verse 1]
Look into my eyes he tells her
I'm gonna say goodbye he says, yeah
Do not cry she begs of him goodbye, yeah
All that day she thinks of his love, yeah
They whip him through the streets and alleys there
The gormless and the baying crowd right there
They can't get enough of that doomsday song
They can't get enough of it all
Listen

[Verse 2]
Listen to the whores he tells her
He fashions paper sculptures of them
Then drags them to the river's bank in the cart
Their soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark
And the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin
Of his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest

[Chorus]
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day

[Verse 3]
Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases
They chase him through the alleys chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest
First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with Satan while they dress like the saints
They know God exists for the Devil told them so
They scream my name aloud down into the well below

[Chorus]
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day

[Outro]
Listen[Chorus]
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

[Verse 1]
We live closer to the earth
Never to the heavens
The stars are never far away
The stars are out tonight
They watch us from behind their shades
Brigitte Jack and Kate and Brad
From behind their tinted window stretch
Gleaming like blackened sunshine

[Chorus]
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

[Verse 2]
Waiting for the first move
Satyrs and their child wives
Waiting for the last move
Soaking up our primitive world

[Chorus]
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

[Verse 3]
Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever

[Bridge]
And they know just we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves
But the stars are out tonight

[Verse 4]
Here they are upon the stairs
Sexless and unaroused
They are stars, they're dying for you
But I hope they live forever
They burn you with their radiant smiles
Trap you with their beautiful eyes
They're broke and shamed or drunk or scared
But I hope they live forever
Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever

[Outro]
And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves on us
But the stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight[Verse 1]
Valentine told me who's to go
Feelings he's treasured most of all
The teachers and the football star
It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hand
Valentine told me so
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day
The rhythm of the crowd
Teddy and Judy down

[Chorus]
Valentine sees it all
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day

[Verse 2]
Valentine told me how it feels
If all the world were under his heels
Or stumbling through the mall
It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hand

[Chorus]
Valentine knows it all
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day
[Bridge]
(Yeah)
Valentine Valentine
(Yeah) (Woo) (Woo)
Valentine Valentine

[Outro]
It's in his scrawny hand
It's in his icy heart
It's happening today
Valentine Valentine
It's in his scrawny hands
It's in his icy heart
It's happening today
Valentine Valentine[Verse 1]
Had to get the train
From Potsdamer platz
You never knew that
That I could do that
Just walking the dead
Sitting in the Dschungel
On Nürnberger Strasse
A man lost in time near KaDeWe
Just walking the dead

[Chorus]
Where are we now?
Where are we now?
The moment you know
You know, you know

[Verse 2]
Twenty thousand people
Cross Bösebrücke
Fingers are crossed
Just in case
Walking the dead

[Chorus]
Where are we now?
Where are we now?
The moment you know
You know, you know
[Outro]
As long as there's sun
As long as there's sun
As long as there's rain
As long as there's rain
As long as there's fire
As long as there's fire
As long as there's me
As long as there's you[Verse 1]
Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in (cry in)
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying (dying)
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying (lying)
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

[Verse 2]
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadn't have pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milkshakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race
The way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful
I want you to walk

[Outro]
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years[Verse 1]
Well, she's a tongue twisting storm
She'll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Verse 2]
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the Blessed, we're The Spiders From Mars

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself
[Bridge]
Come on
Lay it on

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Outro]
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah[Verse 1]
When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

[Verse 2]
Well, all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again

[Chorus]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down

[Verse 3]
Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants
You can give her something too
[Chorus]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down[Verse 1]
People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

[Chorus]
And he was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
The song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long

[Verse 2]
Femme fatales emerged from shadows to watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs to make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady stardust sang his songs of darkness and dismay

[Chorus]
And he was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
The song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise, and he sang
All night, all night long
[Bridge]
Ooh, how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name

[Chorus]
Oh, it was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
And the song went on forever
He was awful nice
Really quite paradise, he sang
All night long

(Get some pussy now)[Verse 1]
I'm an alligator
I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader
I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut
You're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

[Chorus]
(U-u-u-u-u-u) Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
(U-u-u-u-u-u) Put your ray gun to my head
(U-u-u-u-u-u) Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't fake it, baby
Lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

[Chorus]
(U-u-u-u-u-u) Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
(U-u-u-u-u-u) Put your ray gun to my head
(U-u-u-u-u-u) Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh-
Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
(Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe)
('Lectric eye on me babe)
Put your ray gun to my head
(Put your ray gun to my head)
(Ray gun to my head)
Press your space face close to mine, love
(Press your space face close to mine, love)
(Press your space face close to mine, love)
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah
(Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah)
(Freak out in a moonage daydream
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...)

[Outro]
Freak out (Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out...)
Far out (Far out, far out, far out, far out...)
In out (In out, in out, in out, in out...)[Verse 1]
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh oh, oh, oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 2]
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 3]
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural - religiously unkind

[Bridge]
Oh no, love! You're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no, love! You're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone!

[Outro]
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (wonderful)
Gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands[Verse 1]
Stone love - she kneels before the grave
A brave son - who gave his life
To save the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning

[Chorus]
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness
Evolves, by the blindness that surrounds him
[Chorus]
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

[Outro][Intro]
Hey now, now
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll
"Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Verse 2]
I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright
[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Chorus]
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Outro]
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la[Verse 1]
Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock & roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well, he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[Chorus]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock & roll star

[Bridge]
I could do with the money (You know that I could)
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
(You know that I could)
I'd send my photograph to my honey
And I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

[Chorus 2]
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[Chorus 1]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock & roll star
Get on with the money

[Bridge]
I could do with the money (You know that I could)
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
(You know that I could)
I'd send my photograph to my honey
And I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

[Verse 2]
I could fall asleep at night as a rock & roll star
I could fall in love all right as a rock & roll star

[Outro]
Rock & roll star
Rock & roll star
(Just watch me now)[Verse 1]
(Hey man) oh leave me alone you know
(Hey man) oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
(Hey man) I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
(Hey man) my schooldays insane
(Hey man) my work's down the drain
(Hey man) well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right

[Verse 2]
(Hey, man) oh, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
(Hey, man) I can't take you this time, no way
(Hey, man) dear droogie, don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Oh, hit me
[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
And don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Whoa, she's all right

[Outro]
A Suffragette City
A Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City
Whoa, Suffragette city
Ooh, Suffragette City
Ooh-how, Suffragette City
Ooh-how, Suffragette City
Ooh-how, Suffragette
Oh, wham, bam, thank you, Ma'am!
A Suffragette City
A Suffragette City
Quite all right
A Suffragette City
Too fine
A Suffragette City
Ooh, a Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette
Suffragette![Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man,
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah
[Verse 3]
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the naz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Ooh

[Outro]
Ziggy played guitar[Verse 1]
Fame, (fame) makes a man take things over
Fame, (fame) lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, (fame) puts you there where things are hollow
Fame (fame)

[Chorus 1]
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you in... sane (sane)
Fame (fame)

[Verse 2]
Fame, (fame) what you like is in the limo
Fame, (fame) what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, (fame) what you need you have to borrow
Fame (fame)

[Chorus 2]
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to... crime
Fame (fame)

[Bridge]
Could it be the best, could it be?
Really be, really, babe?
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
Could it, babe? Could it, babe?

[Verse 3]
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, (fame) fame, fame, fame (fame)
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool
Fame (fame)

[Chorus 3]
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain check on... pain (pain)
(Fame)

[Outro]
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?

(Feeling so gay, feeling gay)[Verse 1]
They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

[Chorus]
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
She wants the young American

[Verse 2]
Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
But Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"

[Chorus]
(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
She wants the young American

[Bridge]
All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"

[Chorus]
All night
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(He wants the young American)
(All right) All right
He wants the young American

[Verse 3]
Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?

Have you been the un-American?
Just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout Leather, leather everywhere
And not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and

[Chorus]
(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American) young American
(You want the young American) All right
All right
You want the young American

[Verse 4]
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?

[Chorus]
All night
I want the young American
(Young American) young American
(I want the young American)
All right
I want the young American, young American

[Outro]
(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You want I, I want you
(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All right)
All I want is the young American
(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All night)
