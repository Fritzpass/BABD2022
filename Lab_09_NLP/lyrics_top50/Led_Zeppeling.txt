[Intro]
Hey
That's right

[Verse 1]
Asked sweet mama, let me be her kid
She said, "You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid"
Well, I know my baby if I see her in the dark
I said, I know my rider if I see her in the dark

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm going to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Still barrel house, but it's on the riverside, yeah
I know my baby, Lord, I said, is really sloppy drunk
I know my mama, Lord, a brown-skin, but she ain't no plum
Uh-huh, see my baby, tell her, tell her hurry home
Had no loving since my baby been gone
See my baby, tell her hurry on home
I ain't had, Lord, my right mind
Since my rider's been gone
Hey, she promises, she's my rider
I want to tell you, she's my rider
I know you're mine, she's my rider
She ain't but sixteen, but she's my rider
I'm going to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Anybody ask if you and me met, I keep them satisfied
But, uh, see my baby, tell her, tell her to shake my milk
Ain't no Lord since you nowhere
Ah, yeah

[Bridge]
Won't you come in my kitchen

[Verse 3]
She's a kindhearted lady
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze it so hard, I'll fall right out of bed
Squeeze my lemon
'til the juice runs down my leg
I wonder if you know what I'm talking about
Oh, but the way that you squeeze it girl
I swear I'm going to  fall right out of bed

[Verse 4]
Ah, she's a good rider
She's my kindhearted lady
I'm going to take my rider by my side, yeah
I said her front teeth are lined with gold
She's got a mortgage on my body, got a lien on my soul
She's my brown-skin sugar plum[Verse 1]
Want to tell you about the girl I love
My, she looks so fine
She's the only one that I been dreaming of
Maybe someday she will be all mine
I want to tell her that I love her so
I thrill with her every touch
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love

[Chorus]
I got a woman, want to bawl all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said, I got a little woman, and she won't be true

[Verse 2]
Sunday morning, when we go down to church
See the menfolk standing in line
Say they come to pray to the Lord
When my little girl looks so fine
In the evening, when the sun is sinking low
Everybody's with the one they love
I walk the town
Keep a-searching all around
Looking for my street corner girl

[Chorus]
I got a woman, want to bawl all day, yeah
I got a woman, she won't be true, no, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said, I got a little woman, and she won't be true

[Verse 3]
In the bars, with the men who play guitars
Singing, drinking, and remembering the times
My little lover does a midnight shift
She followed around all of the time
I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do
Going to pack my bags and move on my way
'Cause I got a worried mind
Sharing what I thought was mine
Going to leave her where the guitars play

[Chorus]
I got a woman, she won't be true, no, no
I got a woman, want to bawl all day, yeah, yeah, naw, naw
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I got a little woman, and she won't be true

[Outro]
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
I said she won't be true, naw
Yeah, no, yeah, no
(No, no, what can I say?)
Yeah, no, yeah, no
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)
Oh, keep on, keep on, keep on
(No, no, what can I say?)
Keep on, keep on, keep on
(Hey, hey, what can I do?)[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
All those tears I cry ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
All those tears I cry oh, oh, oh, ay, ay
Baby please don't go

[Chorus]
When I read the letter you wrote me, it made me mad mad mad
When I read the words that it told me, it made me sad sad sad
But I still love you so, I can't let you go
I love you, ooh baby I love you

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Every breath I take oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oooh, every move I make
Baby please don't go
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
You hurt me to my soul oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You hurt me to my soul oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Darling please don't go

[Chorus]
When I read the letter you sent me, it made me mad mad mad
When I read the news that it broke, it made me sad sad sad
But I still love you so, and I can't let you go
I love you, ooh baby I love you

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't have to go, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, baby, babe, please, please, please, please
Ah, uh, ah, uh, ah, ah, baby
Ah, ah, I really love you, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh, ooh, ooh, darling
Oh, oh-wo, oh, baby I still love you so
Oh, baby I still love you so, oh-wo ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah (Fire)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh (Fire)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooooh, yeah (Fire)
Oh baby, baby[Verse 1]
Close the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know?
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through

[Chorus]
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you

[Chorus]
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
The pain, the pain without quarter
They ask no quarter
The dogs of doom are howling more![Verse 1]
Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling; walk a while with me
Oh, you've got so much, so much, so much

[Verse 2]
Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road
Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many many men can't see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, ooh!
Really ought to know, oh, oh, oh
I really ought to know
You know I should know, I should know, I should have known[Intro: John Bonham]
"We've done four already but now we're steady
And then they went: One, two, three, four"

[Verse 1]
Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
Got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball
Oh yeah...

[Verse 2]
Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar (Oooh)
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more!
Singing about good things and the sun that lights the day
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way?

[Bridge]
I don't know
Oh oh yeah
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na

[Verse 3]
Sitting round singing songs until the night turns into day
Used to sing on the mountains
But the mountains washed away
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
It sure is fine
I blow my mind
Oh when the tears are going down
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, so good![Verse 1]
It is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low, oooh, oh

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, oooh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Ah, talk, talk, talk, talk
Hey!
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us
But I know that I love you so, ohhhh, oh
But I know that I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient quotient
Ah, upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain, oh yeah
Uhh, ooooh, yeah yeah yeah[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I had a dream, oh yeah
Crazy dream, oh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song, yeah
People won't you listen now? Sing along!
Oh, you don't know what you're missing now
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow now, push, push, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu Starbright
The song remains the same, ooh yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
All you gotta do now, all you gotta do now
Sing out Hare Hare
Dance the Hoochie Koo
City lights are oh so bright
As we go sliding, sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding
Through[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

[Verse 2]
For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

[Chorus]
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now

[Verse 3]
The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin

[Chorus]
Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love for you now
All of my love, all of my love, yes
All of my love to you, child

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind

[Outro]
Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now
All of my love, oh yes
All of my love to you
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love!
Sometimes, sometimes
Hey hey hey hey, ooooh yeah
It's all all all
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
I get a little bit lonely
Just a little, just a little
Just a little bit lonely
Just a little bit lonely[Verse 1]
Oh, baby
Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining
Like a star that can't wait for the night
I hate to think I've been blinded, baby
Why can't I see you tonight?
And the warmth of your smile starts a-burning
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning
Why don't you show up, make it all right?
Yeah, it's all right

[Verse 2]
And if you promised you'd love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me, baby
What ever happened to you?
And you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true
It ain’t the first time believe me, baby
I'm standing here feeling blue
Yeah I'm blue

[Verse 3]
Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around
The clock on the wall's moving slower
My heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found
[Bridge]
Hey, babe!
Ooh! Hands on the clock
Just don’t seem to stop when I’m thinking it over
Ooh! Tired of the light
I just don’t seem to find
Gotta get away, get away
Ooh! I see it in my dreams
But I just don’t seem to be
I’ve got to get all, gotta get it all
Gotta get it all, I’ve got to get all

[Verse 4]
Now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet
I've got no reason to doubt you, baby
It's all a terrible mess
And I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless
When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey
The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah

[Outro]
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I
Light of the love that I found
Light of the, hey, eh, light of the, hey, eh
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found[Verse 1]
Hey, girl, stop what you're doing!
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that I like about you, but I like it a lot
Won't you let me hold you, let me feel your loving touch

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

[Verse 2]
Hey, babe, I got something I think you ought to know
Hey, babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah!
I'm never gonna let you go, 'cause I like your charms

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane! Yeah!

[Outro]
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love me all night)
(I want you to love me all night)
Communication breakdown
(Whoa, ah, a whoa oh)
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love me)
(I want you to love)
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love, yeah)
(I want you to love)[Verse 1]
Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you
I'll leave you when the summertime
Leave you when the summer comes a-rolling
Leave you when the summer comes along

[Verse 2]
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby, baby
I wanna leave you
I ain't joking woman, I've got to ramble
Oh, yeah, baby, baby, I believin'
We really got to ramble (I can hear it calling me)
I can hear it calling me the way it used to do
I can hear it calling me back home

[Bridge 1]
Babe, I'm gonna leave you
Oh, baby, you know, I've really got to leave you
Oh I can hear it calling me
I said don't you hear it calling me the way it used to do?

[Verse 3]
I know I know, I know
I never, never, never, never, never gonna leave you, babe
But I got to go away from this place
I've got to quit you, yeah
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oh, don't you hear it callin' me?
Oh, woman, woman, I know, I know
It feels good to have you back again
And I know that one day baby, it's gonna really grow, yes it is
We gonna go walkin' through the park every day
Come what may, every day, oh
My, my, my, my, my, my babe
I'm gonna leave you, go away
[Bridge 2]
Oh, I miss you, baby
It was really, really good
You made me happy every single day
But now I've got to go away
Oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby, baby
That's when it's calling me
I said that's when it's calling me back home[Verse 1]
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

[Verse 2]
You hurt and abuse telling all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, Lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again

[Extra Verse]
If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet a lot of gentle people there

[Verse 3]
Every day I work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

[Instrumental break 1:58-5:25]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy, baby, let them say what they will
Did your tongue wag so much when I sent you the bill?[Verse 1]
In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home with a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Verse 2]
Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Outro]
I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbours say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part[Verse 1]
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do?
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do?
When I give you all my love
Please, please be true

[Verse 2]
I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all
I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all
I've got to get you together, baby
I'm sure, sure you're gonna call
Oh, when's the last time I done asked you?

[Instrumental break 2:11-4:08]

[Interlude]
I was a young man, I couldn't resist
Started thinking it over, just what I had missed
Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then
Whoops, oh no, yeah, well I did it again
Now I' got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way, that makes eleven
But I'm in constant heaven
I know it's all right in my mind
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine
I can't get through to her cause it doesn't permit
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give

[Bridge]
Oh, Rosie, oh, girl
Oh, Rosie, oh, girl
Steal away now, steal away
Steal away baby, steal away
Little Robert Anthony wants to come and play
Why don't you come to me, baby
Steal away, alright, alright

[Verse 3]
Well they call me the hunter
That's my name
They call me the hunter
That's how I got my fame
Ain't no need to hide
Ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my gun

[Verse 4]
How many more times, barrel house all night long, alright
How many more times, barrel house all night long?
Well, I've got to get to you, baby
So, please come home

[Outro]
Why don't you listen to me, baby?
Why don't you please come home?
Why don't you please come home?
Why don't you please come home?[Verse 1]
Oh, I can't quit you, babe
So I'm gonna put you down for awhile
I said I can't quit you, babe
I guess I'm gonna have to put you down for awhile
Said you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child

[Verse 2]
Said you know I love you, baby
My love for you I could never hide
Oh, you know I love you, baby
My love for you I could never hide
Oh, when I feel you near me, little girl
I know you are my one desire, yeah

[Instrumental break 1:44- 3:41]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
When you hear me moaning and groaning, baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when you hear me moaning and groaning, babe
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when you hear me holler, baby
You know you're my one desire
Yes, you are[Instrumental intro 0:00-1:17]

[Verse 1]
Lying, cheating, hurting, that's all you seem to do
Messing around with every guy in town
Putting me down for thinking of someone new
Always the same, playing your game
Drive me insane, trouble is gonna come to you
One of these days and it won't be long
You'll look for me but, baby, I'll be gone
This is all I gotta say to you, woman

[Chorus]
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come

[Verse 2]
Made up my mind to break you this time
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry
Do what you want, I won't take the brunt
It's fading away, can't feel you anymore
Don't care what you say cause I'm going away to stay
Going to make you pay for that great big hole in my heart
People talking all around
Watch out woman, no longer
Is the joke gonna be on my heart
You been bad to me woman
But it's coming back home to you
[Chorus]
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come[Verse 1]
Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

[Verse 2]
Her style is new, but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

[Verse 4]
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above

[Verse 5]
People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

[Verse 6]
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah

I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

[Instrumental break 2:02-3:40]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 7]
Work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

[Outro]
Heartbreaker; your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker!
Heartbreaker!
Heart![Verse 1]
With a purple umbrella and a fifty cent hat
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Missus cool rides out in her aged Cadillac
Living, loving, she's just a woman

[Chorus]
Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

[Verse 2]
Alimony, alimony, paying your bills
Living, loving, she's just a woman
When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills
Living, loving, she's just a woman

[Chorus]
Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

[Verse 3]
Telling tall tales of how it used to be
Living, loving, she's just a woman
With the butler and the maid and the servants three
Living, loving, she's just a woman

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
Nobody hears a single word you say
Living, loving, she's just a woman
But you keep on talking till your dying day
Living, loving, she's just a woman

[Chorus]
Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

[Outro]
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Living, living, loving, loving, she's just a woman
Li-li-li-li-live, lo-lo-lo-lo-love, she's just a woman[Verse 1]
The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Verse 2]
Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though "Our health" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Bridge]
I tell you no lie

[Verse 3]
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

[Outro]
Ramblin', I'm gonna shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world
Baby, baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do, my baby
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby I think "we gots to part"
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I gotta keep on searching for my baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, baby
I can't find my bluebird!
I listened to what my bluebird said, but I, I can't find my bluebird!
I keep rambling, baby[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

[Bridge]
Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

[Verse 1]
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong
With you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die, my, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration - look, see

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
And so today, my world, it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
And thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
Alright, yeah
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness - I'm glad
[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I should have quit you, a long time ago
Ohh, yeahhh, long time ago
I wouldn't be here, my children
Down on this killing floor

[Verse 2]
I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Oh, I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Everytime I go away and leave you, darling
You send me the blues way down the line

[Instrumental break 1:25-2:41]
[Guitar Solo Hook]

[Verse 3]
Baby, yeah
Give it to me, baby
My, my, my
Take it down a bit
Give it to me, baby
Keep me satisfied
Tryin' worry bout me, baby but I'd never get you with myself
Keep on worrying, baby
Can't keep you satisfied
Huh, let me tell you, baby
You ain't nothing but a two-bit no good jive
[Verse 4]
I went to sleep last night, I worked as hard as I can
I bring home my money
You take my money
Give it to another man
I should have quit you, baby
Oh, such a long time ago, oh
I wouldn't be here with all my troubles
Down on this killing floor

[Verse 5]
Squeeze me baby, till the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze me baby, till the juice runs down my leg
The way you squeeze my lemon, ah
I'm gonna fall right out of bed
Bed, bed, bed, yeah

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Guitar Solo Hook]

[Outro]
I'm going to leave my children down on this killing floor[Verse 1]
And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time

[Verse 2]
And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be?

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time

[Instrumental break 1:36-2:38]

[Verse 3]
So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad, girl
The answer lies with you

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time

[Outro]
Oh the wind won't blow and we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show
Catch the wind, we're going to see it spin, we're going to...sail, leave today
Do do do, bop bop a do-oh. My my my my my my yeah
Everybody I know seems to know me well
But they're never going to know that I move like hell
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Oh lord
Baby baby babe. Huh? Oh I love ya
Do no no no no no no. C'mon now
I want you now[Verse 1]
You need coolin', baby, I'm not foolin'
I'm going to send you back to schoolin'
Way down inside, honey, you need it
I'm goin' to give you my love
I'm goin' to give you my love, oh

[Chorus]
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

[Verse 2]
You've been learnin', baby, I've been yearnin'
All them good times, baby, baby, I've been learnin'
Way, way down inside, honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love, ah
I'm goin' to give you my love, ah, oh

[Chorus]
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

[Instrumental Trip Sequence 1:19-3:20]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You've been coolin', baby, I've been droolin'
All the good times, baby, I've been misusin'
Way, way down inside, I'm goin' to give you my love
I'm goin' to give you every inch of my love
Goin' to give you my love, hey, alright, yes, sir

[Chorus]
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

[Outro]
Way down inside, woman, you need love
Shake for me, girl, I want to be your back door man
Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh!
Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', baby
Keep it coolin', baby[Verse 1]
Ah, caught you smiling at me
That's the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
Ah, all the good times we had
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling never sad, so fine

[Chorus]
As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me

[Verse 2]
Well if the sun shines so bright
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Ah can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on?

[Chorus]
As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me

[Bridge]
My, my
La la la
Come on now it ain't too far
Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue eyed Merle
Come on now well let me tell you
What you're missing, messin' 'round them brick walls

[Acoustic Solo]

[Verse 3]
So of one thing I am sure
It's a friendship so pure
Angels singing all around my door, so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do
Spend my natural life with you
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine

[Outro]
When you're old and your eyes are dim
There ain't no old Shep gonna happen again
We'll still go walking down country lanes
I'll sing the same old song, hear me call your name[Verse 1]
Bright light almost blinding
Black night still there shining
I can't stop, keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend, she once told me
You got love, you ain't lonely
Now she's gone and left me only
Looking for what I knew

[Chorus]
Mmm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just

[Verse 2]
Met a man on the roadside crying
Without a friend, there's no denying
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding
Looking for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs you
Don't let them down, although it grieves you
Some day you'll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew

[Chorus]
Mmm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just
I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, It's very easy
It's very easy, It's easy, easy, yeah[Verse 1]
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my friends coming, riding many a mile
Friends, you get some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my dear friends
To keep me from the gallows pole?
What did you bring me to keep me from the gallows pole?
I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold
You know that we're too damn poor to keep you from the gallows pole

[Verse 2]
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my brother coming, riding many a mile
Brother, you get me some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my brother, to keep me from the gallows pole?
Brother, I brought you some silver, yeah
I brought a little gold, I brought a little of everything
To keep you from the gallows pole
Yes, I brought you to keep you from the gallows pole

[Verse 3]
Hangman, hangman, turn your head awhile
I think I see my sister coming, riding many mile, mile, mile
Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand
Take him to some shady bower
Save me from the wrath of this man
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this mad, man
Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile
Tell me that I'm free to ride
Ride for many mile, mile, mile
[Verse 4]
Oh yes, you got a fine sister
She warmed my blood from cold
She warmed my blood to boiling hot to keep you from the gallows pole
Your brother brought me silver, your sister warmed my soul
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging from the gallows pole
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging from the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole!
Swingin' on the gallows pole!
Swingin' on the gallows pole!
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Pole, pole, pole, pole, pole, pole, yeah

[Outro]
Ah-ha-ha
Swingin'
Swingin' on the gallows pole!
I gotta swing!
See-saw marjory daw
I gotta swing!
See-saw knock at my door
I gotta sing
Keep on singing[Intro]​
(2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 1]
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Chorus]
Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 2]
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Verse 3]
So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing[Pre-Chorus]
Been working from seven to eleven every night
Really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right

[Verse 1]
I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah
Cause I love you baby
How I love you darling
How I love you, baby
My beloved little girl, little girl

[Chorus]
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Everybody trying to tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you I really did the best I could

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been, I've been working from seven to eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag
Lord, yeah, that ain't right

[Chorus]
Since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Watch out

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Said I've been crying, yeah
Oh, my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?

[Verse 3]
Do you remember mama
When I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me
You didn't want me no more, yeah
I open my front door, hear my back door slam
You know, I must have one of them
Newfangled, newfangled back-door men

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been working from
Seven, seven, seven, to eleven, eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, drag
Yeah, it makes it a drag

[Chorus]
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose, I'm about to lose my worried mind
Oh yeah
Just one more, just one more, oooh, yeah
Since I've been loving you, I'm gonna lose my worried mind[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, four
One, two

[Verse 1]
Measuring a summer's day
I only find it slips away to grey
The hours they bring me pain

[Chorus]
Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between

[Verse 2]
Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these?
To think of us again
And I do

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between[Verse 1]
I don't know how I'm going to tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend, the boy next door

I can't believe what people saying
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town

[Bridge]
And when I'm out I see you walking
Why don't your eyes see me
Could it be you've found another game to play
What did mama say to me?

[Chorus]
That's the way, oh
That's the way it ought to be
Yeah, yeah, mama say
That's the way it ought to stay

[Verse 2]
And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying
Had they got you hypnotized?

And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters
And all you do is stand and cry

[Bridge]
I don't know what to say about it
When all you ears have turned away
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see
Is that the way it ought to stay?

[Chorus]
That's the way
That's the way it ought-ta be
Oh don't you know now, mama said
That's the way it's going to stay, yeah[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Ah, ah, child, way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting
Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, I can't keep away

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I got to roll, can't stand still
Got a flaming heart, can't get my fill
Eyes that shine, burning red
Dreams of you all through my head
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahh

[Bridge]
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Tell me would you do me now
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Move me while you groove me now

[Verse 3]
Take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out
Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friend she' gon' be a star
I don't know, but I've been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 4]
All I ask for, all I pray
Steady rollin' woman gonna come my way
Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahh

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Hey baby,  pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby,  pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby,  pretty baby, oh baby[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, it's crying time
Oh, baby, I got to fly
Got to try to find a way
Got to try to get away
Because you know I gotta get away from you, babe

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, the river's red
Ah, baby, in my head
There's a funny feeling going on
I don't think I can hold out long

[Chorus]
And when the owls cry in the night
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry
Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the river runs dry, baby how do you feel

[Verse 3]
Craze, baby, the rainbow's end
Mmm, baby, it's just a den for those who hide
Who hide their love to depths of life
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe

[Chorus]
And when the owls cry in the night
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry
Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the river runs dry, baby how do you feel
Ah, ah, ah
Baby how do you feel?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Ooh yeah, brave I endure
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
They can't hold the wrath of those who walk
And the boots of those who march
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago

[Outro]
Oooh, yeah
Oooh, yeah[Verse 1]
Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank, all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching, in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers, in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same

[Verse 2]
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow, could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake

[Verse 3]
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

[Verse 4]
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings...
La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems...[Verse 1]
Walking in the park just the other day baby
What do you, what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sitting on the grass
With flowers in their hair said
Hey, boy, do you want to score?
And you know how it is?
I really don't know what time it was, woah, oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay a while

[Verse 2]
I didn't notice but it had
Got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me
And asked us said please, hey, would we care
To all get in line
Get in line
Well you know, they asked us to stay for tea
And have some fun
Oh, oh, oh, he said that his friends
Would all drop by, ooh

[Verse 3]
Why don't you take a good look
At yourself and describe what you see?
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book
On a shelf rusting
Ah, not trying to fight it
You really don't care if they're coming?
Oh, oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh (No, no, no!)
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
If you go down in the streets
Today, baby you better
You better open your eyes
Folk down there really don't care
Really don't care, don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm going to do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly, ooh

[Outro]
I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really don't know[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Yes it has

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since The Book of Love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

[Verse 3]
Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Open your arms, opens your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder
[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder
Ohhhh, woah

[Verse 5]
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
[Outro]
And she's buying a stairway to heaven[Verse 1]
The Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all, oh

[Chorus]
I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

[Verse 2]
The apples of the valley hold
The seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
Mortals never know, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow

[Verse 3]
The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on
Sing as you raise your bow (Ride on)
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back
Bring it back

[Outro]
At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes!
Ahhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhh

Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Oh now, oh now, oh now, oh
Oh now, oh now, oh now
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Oh now, oh now, oh now, oh
Oh now, oh now, oh now
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it[Verse 1]
If it keeps on raining
Levee's going to break
If it keeps on raining
The levee's going to break
When the levee breaks
We'll have no place to stay

[Verse 2]
Mean old levee
Taught me to weep and moan, oh
Mean old levee
Taught me to weep and moan
It's got what it takes
To make a mountain man leave his home
Oh well, oh well, oh well, ooh

[Bridge]
Oh don't it make you feel bad
When you're trying to find your way home
You don't know which way to go
If you're going down south
They got no work to do
If you're going north to Chicago

[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Crying won't help you
Praying won't do you no good
No, crying won't help you
Praying won't do you no good
When the levee breaks
Mama, you got to move, ooh

[Verse 4]
All last night
I sat on the levee and moaned
All last night
Sat on the levee and moaned
Thinking about my baby
And my happy home
Oh-ho

[Bridge]
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Going
I'm going to Chicago
Going to Chicago
Sorry, but I can't take you
Going down
Going down now
Going down
I'm going down now
Going down
Going down
Going down
Going down
Ohh
Going down
Going down now
Going down
Going down now
Going down
Going down now
Going down
Going, dow- dow- dow- dow- down now
Ooh, ooh[Verse 1]
Ooooh
Drop down, baby, let your daddy see
Drop down, my lady, just dream of me
Well, my mama, allow me to fool around all night long
Well, I may look like I'm crazy, I sure know right from wrong

[Verse 2]
See me comin', throw your man outdoor
Ain't no stranger, done been this way before
See me comin', mama, I throw your man outdoor
I ain't no stranger, I been this way before

[Verse 3]
Put on your night shirt and your morning gown
You know by night I'm gonna shake 'em on down
Put on your night shirt, Mama, and your morning gown
Well, you know by night I'm sure gonna shake 'em on down
Shake it, shake it

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 4]
Oooh, your custard pie, yeah, sweet and nice
When you cut it, mama, save me a slice
Your custard pie, yeah
I declare you're sweet and nice like your custard pie
When you cut it, mama, mama, please save me a slice

[Outro]
Oh, I chew on a piece of your custard pie
I chew on a piece of your custard pie
I chew on a piece of your custard pie
I chew on a piece of your custard pie
Drop down, drop down, drop down
Drop down, drop down,  yeah
Drop down, drop down
I chew on a piece of your custard pie[Chorus]
Let me take you to the movie
Can I take you to the show?
Let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

[Verse 1]
From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go
From the door comes Satan's daughter
And it only goes to show

[Hook]
You know

[Verse 2]
There's an angel on my shoulder
In my hand a sword of gold
Let me wander in your garden
And the seeds of love I'll sow

[Hook]
You know

[Verse 3]
So the world is spinning faster
Are you dizzy when you stall??
Let the music be your master
Will you heed the master's call?
Oh, Satan and man
[Verse 4]
Said there ain't no use in crying
Cause it will only, only drive you mad
Does it hurt to hear them lying?
Was this the only world you had? Oh, oh

[Chorus]
So let me take you, take you to the movie
Can I take you, baby, to the show?
Why don't you let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

[Hook]
You know, that's right[Verse 1]
In my time of dying
I want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do
Is take my body home

[Chorus]
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus got to make up
You know
Jesus going to make up
Jesus going to make up my dying bed

[Verse 2]
Meet me, Jesus, meet me
Ooh, meet me in the middle of the air
If my wings should fail me, Lord
Oh, please meet me with another pair

[Chorus]
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Oh, oh
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus going to make up
Somebody, somebody
Oh, oh
Jesus going to make up
Jesus going to make up my dying bed

[Verse 3]
Oh, Saint Peter
At the gates of heaven
Won't you let me in?
I never did no harm
I never did no wrong
Ah, oh, Gabriel, let me blow your horn
Let me blow your horn
Oh, I never did no harm
Did no harm
I've only been this young once
I never thought I'd do anybody no wrong
No, not once, oh no

[Bridge]
Oh yeah!

[Verse 4]
Oh, I did somebody some good
Somebody some good, yes, oh
Oh, did somebody some good, yeah
I must have did somebody some good, yeah
Oh, I believe I did
I see the smiling faces
I know I must have left some traces, oh

[Bridge]

[Verse 5]
And I see them in the streets
And I see them in the field
And I hear them shouting under my feet
And I know it's got to be real
Oh Lord, deliver me
All the wrong I've done
Oh, you can deliver me, Lord
I only wanted to have some fun
Oh, hear the angels marching, hear them marching
Hear them marching, hear them marching, the marching

[Verse 6]
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, ah, oh
Now my Jesus, hey, yeah, it's got to be my Jesus, oh
It's got to be, it's got to be my Jesus, it's got to be, oh
It's got to be my Jesus, oh, take me home
Come on, come on, I can hear the angels singing
Oh, here they come, here they come, here they come
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
Oh, it feels pretty good up here, pretty good up here
Oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Ooh I'll see you again, [?] come on
Oh, don't you make it my dying, dying, dying

[Outro]
(Coughing)
Cough
That's gotta be the one, hasn't it?!
Come have a listen then
Oh yes, thank you[Intro]

[Verse 1]
And if you feel that you can't go on
And your will's sinking low
Just believe, and you can't go wrong
In the light, you will find the road
You will find the road

[Verse 2]
Hey, ooh, did you ever believe that I could leave you
Standing out in the cold?
Yeah, baby, I know how it feels cause I have slipped through
To the very depths of my soul, yeah
Oh-ho, baby, I just want to show you what a clear view
It is from every bend in the road
Now listen to me
Oh, whoa-whoa, as I was
And really would be for you, too, honey
As you would for me, oh, I would share your load
Let me share your load
Ooh, let me share, share your load

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
And if you feel that you can't go on
In the light, you will find the road
Hey, oh ho, the the winds of change may blow around you
But that will always be so
Whoa whoa, when love is pain it can devour you, but you are never alone
I will share your load, I will share your load
Baby, let me, oh, let me
[Bridge]
In the light
Everybody needs the light
Ooh, yeah yeah
Ooh, baby
In the light, in the light, in the light
[?]

[Outro]
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light, ooh, yeah
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light, ooh yeah yeah
Light, light, light, in the light, everybody, come on now[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

[Verse 2]
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Ooh, baby, I been flying
No yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Oh, ooh, yeah I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying
[Verse 4]
Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

[Verse 5]
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

[Verse 6]
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Ooooh
[Verse 7/Outro]
Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there
Oh..Come on, oh, let me take you there...let me take you there
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, let me take you there...let me take you there[Verse 1]
Then, as it was, then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea
Flying skies of fortune, each a separate way
On the wings of maybe, downing birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn’t have to go
But as the eagle leaves the nest, got so far to go

[Hook]
Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
Did you ever really need somebody
And really need 'em bad?
Did you ever really want somebody
The best love you ever had?
Do you ever remember me, baby?
Did it feel so good?
Cause it was just the first time
And you knew you would

[Verse 3]
Through the eyes and I sparkle, senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way, see your feathers preen
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest, the nest is in our soul

[Hook]
Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be
Oh darling, oh darling
Oh, oh darling, oh yeah, oh darling

[Outro]
I'm never going to leave you
I'm never going to leave
Holding on, ten years gone
Ten years gone, holding on, ten years gone
I'm never, I'm never
Oooh, yeah...[Verse 1]
I've been to London, seen seven wonders
I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it
I always knew what it was for

There can be no denying
That the wind'll shake 'em down
And the flat world's flying
There's a new plague on the land

[Chorus]
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands

[Verse 2]
Traversed the planet, when heaven sent me
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight
I hear the rested rivers call

And the wind is crying
From a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lying
On the dark side of the globe

[Chorus]
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
Yeah, yeah, yeah[repeat]

[Bridge]
You got me rocking when I ought to be a-rolling
Darling, tell me, darling, which way to go
You keep me rocking, baby, then you keep me stalling
Won't you tell me, darling, which way to go, that's right

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry
And I would dearly like to know
Of all this wonder, of earthly plunder
Will it leave us anything to show?

And our time is flying
See the candle burning low
Is the new world rising
From the shambles of the old?

[Chorus]
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just, if we could just, if we could just
If we could just, if we could just join hands
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah
Ah, ah, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right[Verse 1]
Greasy slicked down
Groovy leather trim
I like the way you hold the road
Mama, it ain't no sin

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

[Verse 2]
Ooh, trouble-free transmission
Helps your oils flow
Mama, let me pump your gas
Mama, let me do it all

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

[Verse 3]
Check that heavy metal
Underneath your hood
Baby, I can work all night
Believe I got the perfect tools
[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

[Verse 4]
Automobile with comfort
Really built with style
Specialist tradition
Mama, let me feast my eyes

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

[Verse 5]
Factory air-conditioned
Heat begins to rise
Guaranteed to run for hours
Mama, you're the perfect size

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout
[Verse 6]
Grooving on the freeway
Gauges all are red
Gun down on my gasoline
Believe I'm gonna crack your head

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout...

[Bridge]
I can't stop talking about
I can't stop talking about
Ooh, yeah, yes
Drive on
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes
I'm coming through

[Verse 7]
Come to me for service
Every hundred miles
Baby, let me check your points
Fix your overdrive

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout
[Verse 8]
Ooh yeah, fully automatic
Comes in any size
Makes me wonder what I did
Before we synchronized

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

[Verse 9]
Oooh, feather-light suspension
Konis couldn't hold
I'm so glad I took a look
Inside your showroom doors

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout
Oh, I can't
Oh, I can't

[Outro]
Oh, I can't stop talking about love
I can't stop talking about love
Ooh, let me go on down, go on down
Go on down, go on down, go on down, yeah

I can't stop talking about
I can't stop talking about love, oh yeah
I can't stop talking about love or my baby
I can't stop talking about love, my baby
My baby, my baby, yeah

Push, push
Push it
Push, push
Oooooooohhh[Verse 1]
It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turned to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?
With all the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Oh, the songs to sing
When we at last return again

[Verse 2]
Sending off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole
Oh to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah

[Verse 3]
Into the sun, the south, the north
At last the birds have flown
Shackles of commitments fell
In pieces on the ground
Oh, to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh, to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd, yeah
[Verse 4]
To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
To guide us from the curving path
That turns our feet to stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head, with heavy feet, yeah

[Guitar Solo]
Oooooh, yeah

[Verse 5]
Days went by when you and I
Bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant
Our mutual child did grow
Oh, the sweet refrain
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh Albion remains
Sleeping now to rise again

[Verse 6]
Wandering and wandering
What place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
For the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth, earth
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way
[Bridge]
Oh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
Oh the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
Ah, ah, ah[Verse 1]
Oh, nobody's fault but mine
Nobody's fault but mine
Trying to save my soul tonight

[Hook]
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

[Verse 2]
Devil he told me to roll
Devil he told me to roll
How to roll the lot you like

[Hook]
Nobody's fault but mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Brother he showed me the gong
Brother he showed me the ding dong ding dong
How to kick that gong to light

[Hook]
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine
[Verse 4]
Got a monkey on my back
M-m-m-m-monkey on my back, back, back, back
Gonna change my ways tonight

[Hook]
Nobody's fault but mine

[Outro]
How to kick that gong to light
N-n-n-n-n-no, nobody's fault
