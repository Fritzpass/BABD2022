[Verse 1]
Well, you're my friend
And can you see
Many times we've been out drinking
Many times we've shared our thoughts
But did you ever, ever notice
The kind of thoughts I got?
Well, you know I have a love
A love for everyone I know
And you know I have a drive
To live, I won't let go
But can you see its opposition
Comes rising up sometimes?
That its dreadful and position
Comes blacking in my mind

[Chorus]
And that I see a darkness[x3]
Did you know how much I love you?
Is a hope that somehow you
Can save me from this darkness

[Verse 2]
Well, I hope that someday, buddy
We have peace in our lives
Together or apart
Alone or with our wives
And we can stop our whoring
And pull the smiles inside
And light it up forever
And never go to sleep
My best unbeaten brother
This isn't all I see

[Chorus][Verse 1]
Well I won't back down, no I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down
Going to stand my ground, won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from dragging me down
Going to stand my ground and I won't back down

[Chorus]
Hey baby, there is no easy way out
Hey I will stand my ground and I won't back down

[Verse 2]
Well I know what's right, I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushing me around
But I stand my ground and I won't back down

[Chorus][Produced by John Carter Cash and Rick Rubin]

[Intro-Johnny Cash]
It all began when they took me from my home
And put me on Death Row
A crime for which I am totally innocent, you know

[Verse 1--Johnny Cash]
I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood

[Chorus--Johnny Cash]
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die
[Verse 2-Johnny Cash]
I hear stories from the chamber
Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
He died upon the cross
Might I say, it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told
My kill-hand's
Tatooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist
In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold
It's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away
Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied
[Chorus-Johnny Cash]
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

[Verse 3-Johnny Cash]
And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hopin'
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief
A life for a life
And a truth for a truth
And I've got nothing left to loose
And I'm not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way that's helping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lie[Verse 1]
I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through this world below
There's no sickness, no toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm going there to see my Father
And all my loved ones who've gone on

[Chorus]
I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home

[Verse 2]
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is hard and steep
But beauteous fields arise before me
Where God's redeemed, their vigils keep

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm going there to see my Mother
She said she'd meet me when I come

[Chorus]
So, I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home[Intro]
I was totin' my pack along the dusty Winnemucca road
When along came a semi with a high an' canvas covered load
"If you're goin' to Winnemucca, Mack, with me you can ride"
And so I climbed into the cab and then I settled down inside
He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand
And I said, "Listen, I've traveled every road in this here land"

[Chorus]
I've been everywhere, man
I've been everywhere, man
Crossed the desert's bare, man
I've breathed the mountain air, man
Of travel I've a'had my share, man
I've been everywhere

Tocopilla, Barranquilla, and Padilla, I'm a killer

[Chorus]
I've been everywhere, man

Crossed the desert's bare, man
I've breathed the mountain air, man
Of travel I've a'had my share, man
I've been everywhere

[Verse 2]
I've been to Boston, Charleston, Dayton, Louisiana
Washington, Houston, Kingston, Texarkana
Monterey, Faraday, Santa Fe, Tallapoosa
Glen Rock, Black Rock, Little Rock, Oskaloosa
Tennessee to Hennessey, Chicopee, Spirit Lake
Grand Lake, Devil's Lake, Crater Lake, for Pete's sake

[Chorus]
I've been everywhere, man
I've been everywhere, man
Crossed the desert's bare, man
I've breathed the mountain air, man
Of travel I've a'had my share, man
I've been everywhere

[Verse 3]
I've been to Louisville, Nashville, Knoxville, Ombabika
Schefferville, Jacksonville, Waterville, Costa Rica
Pittsfield, Springfield, Bakersfield, Shreveport

Idaho, Jellico, Argentina, Diamantina
Pasadena, Catalina, see what I mean'a

[Chorus]

I've breathed the mountain air, man
Of travel I've a'had my share, man
I've been everywhere

[Verse 4]
I've been to Pittsburgh, Parkersburg, Gravelbourg, Colorado
Ellensburg, Rexburg, Vicksburg, El Dorado
Larimore, Admore, Haverstraw, Chatanika
Chaska, Nebraska, Alaska, Opelaka
Baraboo, Waterloo, Kalamazoo, Kansas City
Sioux City, Cedar City, Dodge City, what a pity

[Chorus]
I've been everywhere, man
I've been everywhere, man
Crossed the desert's bare, man
I've breathed the mountain air, man
Of travel I've a'had my share, man
I've been everywhere

[Outro]
I've been everywhere[Verse 1]
You wired me awake
And hit me with a hand of broken nails
You tied my lead and pulled my chain
To watch my blood begin to boil

[Chorus]
But I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run
I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run

[Verse 2]
Too cold to start a fire
I'm burning diesel, burning dinosaur bones
I'll take the river down to Stillwater
And ride a pack of dogs

[Chorus]
But I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run
I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run
[Verse 3]
When the forest burns along the road
Like God's eyes in my headlights
When the dogs are looking for their bones
And it's raining icepicks on your steel shore

[Chorus]
I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
I'm going to break my rusty cage and run
I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run
I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run
I'm going to break
I'm going to break my
Going to break my rusty cage and run[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head

[Verse 2: Johnny Cash]
I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head and my hands
The sheriff, he asked me
"Why had I run?"
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash]
Here in the courthouse
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
"Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find"
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my
[Verse 4: Johnny Cash]
Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on the hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'll ride together
To kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy
For soon I'll be dead

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head[Pre-Chorus]
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there

[Chorus]
Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

[Pre-Chorus]
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone to care

[Chorus]
Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith[Intro]
And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder. One of the four beasts saying, "Come and see." And I saw, and behold a white horse

[Verse 1]
There's a man going 'round taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around

[Chorus]
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
[Verse 2]
Till Armageddon no salaam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise men will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around
Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

[Chorus]
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around
[Outro]
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts. And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him[Pre-Chorus]
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day

[Chorus 1]
Keep smiling through
Just like you
Always do
Until the blue skies drive
The dark clouds
Far away

[Chorus 2]
And will you please say hello
To the folks that I know
Tell them that I won't be long
And they'll be happy to know
That when you saw me go
I was singing this song

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day

Yeah We'll meet again
I Don't know where
I Don't know when
But I do know
That We'll meet again
Some sunny day

[Chorus 1]
So honey
Keep on smiling through
Just like you
Always do
Until the blue skies drive
The dark clouds
Far away

[Chorus 2]
And will you please say hello
To the folks that I know
Tell them that I won't be long
And they'll be happy to know
That when you saw me go
I was singing this song

We'll meet again

But I know
We'll meet again

[Verse]
The beast in me
Is caged by frail and fragile bars
Restless by day
And by night rants and rages at the stars
God help the beast in me
The beast in me
Has had to learn to live with pain
And how to shelter from the rain
And in the twinkling of an eye
Might have to be restrained
God help the beast in me
Sometimes it tries to kid me
That it's just a teddy bear
And even somehow manage to vanish in the air
And that is when I must beware
Of the beast in me that everybody knows
They've seen him out dressed in my clothes
Patently unclear
If it's New York or New Year
God help the beast in me[Verse 1]
Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed
Where the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold
Where the miles are marked in the blood and gold
I'll meet you further on up the road


Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring
My lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing
I got a song to sing, it keeps me out of the cold
And I'll meet you further on up the road

[Hook]
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Where the way is dark and the night is cold
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road

[Verse 2]
Now I been out in the desert, just doin' my time
Searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign
If there's a light up ahead, well brother I don't know
But I got this fever burnin' in my soul

[Bridge]
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
[Hook]
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road[Chorus 1]
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down

[Verse 1]
Well my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, "John, go do My will!"

[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down
[Chorus 1]
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

[Verse 2]
Well, you may throw your rock and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

[Chorus 1]
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell them that God's gonna cut 'em down[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Chorus]
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 1]
When I hear that trumpet sound
I'm going to rise right out of the ground
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
Well, look way down the river
And what do you think I see
I see a band of angels
And they're coming after me

[Chorus]
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 2]
Well, look down yonder, Gabriel
Put your feet on the land and sea
But Gabriel, don't you blow your trumpet
Until you hear from me
[Chorus]
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 3]
Well meet me, Jesus, meet me
Meet me in the middle of the air
And if these wings don't fail me
I will meet you anywhere

[Chorus]
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 4]
Well meet me, Mother and Father
Meet me down the river road
And Mama, you know that I'll be there
When I check in my load

[Chorus]
Ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down[Verse 1]
My daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me "Sue."

[Verse 2]
Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named "Sue."

[Verse 3]
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

[Verse 4]
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me "Sue."
[Verse 5]
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: "My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!"

[Verse 6]
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

[Verse 7]
I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

[Verse 8]
And he said: "Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong
[Verse 9]
He said: "Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

[Verse 10]
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name![Intro]
Ira Hayes
Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 1]
Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
Until the white man stole the water rights
And the sparkling water stopped
Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
[Bridge]
There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

[Verse 2]
And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Bridge]
Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
Everybody shook his hand

[Verse 3]
But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no home, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when the Indians dance
[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 4]
Then Ira started drinking hard
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!
He died drunk one morning
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 5]
Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died[ Johnny Cash &amp; June Carter)

Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights of town
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try
Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry

[Verse 2]
Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you: "Bye, bye, bye!"
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry

[Chorus]
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

[Verse 3]
I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

[Verse 4]
When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me: "Why, why, why?"
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry
[Outro]
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been
You're gonna cry, cry, cry[Verse 1]
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

[Verse 2]
When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

[Verse 4]
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away[Verse 1]
Now this here's a story about the Rock Island Line
Well the Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate
Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well a train driver he pulled up to the tollgate
And a man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said

[Chorus]
I got livestock
I got livestock
I got cows
I got pigs
I got sheep
I got mules
I got all livestock

[Verse 2]
Well he said you're alright boy you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through so he went on through the tollgate
And as he went through he started picking up a little bit of speed
Picking up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned and looked back at the man he said

[Chorus]
Well I fooled you
I fooled you
I got pigiron
I got pigiron
I got all pigiron

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Verse 3]
Looked cloudy in the west and it looked like rain
Round the curve came a passenger train
North bound train on a southbound track
He's alright a leaving but he won't be back

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Verse 4]
Oh I may be right and I may be wrong
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well the engineer said before he died
There were two more drinks that he'd like to try
Conductor said what could they be
A hot cup of coffee and a cold glass of tea

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island LineThey gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia
Saying Steve you're way behind time
This is not 38 this is old 97
You must put her into Spencer on time

He turned around and said to his black greasy fireman
"Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Old Mountain
Watch old 97 roll"

And then a telegram came to Washington station
This is how it read:
It said, "That brave engineer that has run old 97
Is lying down in Danville, dead"

He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam

So now all you pretty ladies you better take a warning
From this time on and learn
Don't you speak hard words to your true lover husband
He may leave you and never return[Verse 1]
Some glad morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

[Chorus]
I'll fly away, o Glory
I'll fly away (In the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away

[Verse 2]
When the shadows of this life are gone
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars has flown
I'll fly away

[Chorus]
I'll fly away, o Glory
I'll fly away (In the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away

[Verse 3]
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end
I'll fly away

[Chorus]
I'll fly away, o Glory
I'll fly away (In the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly awaynull[Verse 1]
Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

[Chorus]
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

[Verse 2]
The Judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, you won't have to die"
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

Now the scaffold seemed high, and eternity was near
She stood in the crowd, but she shed not a tear
But some times at night when the cold wind calls
She comes to my grave and she moans o'er my bones

[Chorus]
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

[Outro]
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me[Verse 1]
I saw her through the window today
She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon Cafe
I started to keep going but something made me stop
She used to love me a lot

She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in and I'd give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot

I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said "where have you been? It's been a while"
She was glad to see me, I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

[Hook 1]
She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said goodbye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

[Verse 2]
I remember how good it was back then
And I said "it's not too late to start again
We could spend the night together, take up where we left off"
She used to love me a lot

But I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
"Yes I'm in need of something, but something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot"

[Hook 2]
I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said goodbye
She just left me standing there, I've never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot

[Outro]
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot[Verse]
I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench, an old man was sitting there
I said "Your old court house is kind of run down"
He said "Naw, it'll do for our little town"
I said "Your old flag pole is leaned a little bit"
And that's a ragged old flag you got hanging on it
He said "Have a seat", and I sat down
"Is this the first time you've been to our little town?"
I said "I think it is"
He said "I don't like to brag, but we're kind of proud of
That Ragged Old Flag
You see, we got a little hole in that flag there
When Washington took it across the Delaware
And It got powder burned the night Francis Scott Key sat watching it
Writing Say Can You See
It got a rip in New Orleans, with Packingham & Jackson
Tugging at its seams
And It almost fell at the Alamo
Beside the Texas flag
But she waved on though
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
There was Robert E. Lee and Beauregard and Bragg
And the south wind blew hard on
That Ragged Old Flag
On Flanders Field in World War I
She got a big hole from a Bertha Gun
She turned blood red in World War II
She hung limp, and low, a time or two
She was in Korea, Vietnam, She went where she was sent
By her Uncle Sam
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam
And now they've about quit waving back here at home
In her own good land here She's been abused
She's been burned, dishonored, denied an' refused
And the government for which she stands
Has been scandalized throughout out the land
And she's getting thread bare, and she's wearing thin
But she's in good shape, for the shape she's in
Because she's been through the fire before
And I believe she can take a whole lot more"

[Outro]
So we raise her up every morning
And we bring her down slow every night
We don't let her touch the ground
And we fold her up right
On second thought
I do like to brag
Because  I'm mighty proud of
That Ragged Old Flag[Verse 1]
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

[Verse 2]
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild
[Chorus]
I fell in to a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

[Outro]
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring...[Verse 1]
An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy drawl

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 2]
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire as they ride on, hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
"If you want to save your soul from hell from ridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies"
[Chorus]
Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
I found him by the railroad track this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said
He said they let me out of prison out in Frisco
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

[Chorus]
Give my love to Rose please, won't you mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

[Verse 2]
Won't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
Because it ain't right that she should live alone
Mister here's a bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
Now don't forget to give my love to Rose
[Chorus]
Give my love to Rose please, won't you mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose[Verse 1]
A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 2]
He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 3]
He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again
[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 4]
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself atlast he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 5]
Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered around
And wondered at his final words

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town[Verse]
At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Because I still miss someone

Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

I still miss someone

Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
I still miss someoneI want to live
I want to give
I've been a miner
For a heart of gold
It's these expressions
I never give
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean
For a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searching
For a heart of gold
You keep me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
I've been a miner
For a heart of gold[Verse 1]
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

[Verse 2]
I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
