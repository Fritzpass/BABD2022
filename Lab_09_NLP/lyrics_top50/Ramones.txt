[Intro]
1-2-3-4

[Verse 1]
When I'm lying in my bed at night
I don't want to grow up
Nothing ever seems to turn out right
I don't want to grow up

[Chorus]
How do you move in a world of fog that's
Always changing things
Makes me wish that I could be a dog

[Verse 2]
When I see the price that you pay
I don't want to grow up
I don't ever want to be that way
I don't want to grow up

[Chorus]
Seems that folks turn into things
That they never want
The only thing to live for is today

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna put a hole in my T.V. set
I don't want to grow up
Open up the medicine chest
I don't want to grow up
[Chorus]
I don't want to have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't want to be filled with doubt
I don't want to be a good boy scout
I don't want to have to learn to count
I don't want to have the biggest amount
No, I don't want to grow up

[Verse 4]
Well, when I see my parents fight
I don't want to grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't want to grow up

[Chorus]
I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothing out there but sad and gloom
I don't want to live in a big old tomb on Grand Street

[Verse 5]
When I see the 5 o'clock news
I don't want to grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
[Chorus]
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't want to put no money down
I don't want to get a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't want to float on a broom
Fall in love, get married then boom
How the hell did it get here so soon
No, I don't want to grow up[Verse 1]
Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Does whatever a spider can
Spins a web, any size
Catches thieves just like flies
Look out, here comes the Spider-Man

Is he strong? Listen, Bud
He's got radioactive blood
Can he swing from a thread?
Take a look overhead
Hey, there! There goes the Spider-Man

[Bridge]
In the chill of the night
At the scene of a crime
Like a streak of light
He arrives just in time

Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
Wealth and fame, he's ignored
Action is his reward
Look out, here comes the Spider-Man

Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
Wealth and fame, he's ignored
Action is his reward
To him, life is a great big bang up
Wherever there's a hang up
You'll find the Spider-Man![Chorus 1: The Ramones]
I used to be on an endless run
Believe in miracles 'cause I'm one
I have been blessed with the power to survive
After all these years I'm still alive

[Verse 1: The Ramones]
I'm out here kicking with the band
I am no longer a solitary man
Every day my time runs out
Lived like a fool, that's what I was about, oh

[Chorus 2: The Ramones]
I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you

[Verse 2: The Ramones]
Tattooed your name on my arm
I always said my girl's a good luck charm
If she can find a reason to forgive
Then I can find a reason to live

[Chorus 1: The Ramones]
I used to be on an endless run
Believe in miracles 'cause I'm one
I have been blessed with the power to survive
After all these years I'm still alive
[Chorus 2: The Ramones]
I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you

[Verse 3: The Ramones]
I close my eyes and think how it might be
The future's here today
It's not too late
It's not too late, yeah!

[Chorus 2: The Ramones]
I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you oh yeah[Verse 1]
Have I ever told you
How good it feels to hold you
It isn't easy to explain

[Bridge]
And though I'm really trying
I think I may start crying
My heart can't wait another day

[Pre-Chorus]
When you kiss me I just got to
Kiss me I just got to
Kiss me I just got to say

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you
Come on baby
Baby, I love you
Baby I love, I love only you

[Verse 2]
I can't live without you
I love everything about you
I can't help it if I feel this way

[Bridge]
Oh I'm so glad I found you
I want my arms around you
I love to hear you call my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh tell me that you feel
Tell me that you feel
Tell me that you feel the same

Come on baby

Somebody called me on the phone
Say, Hey hey, is Arty home?
You want to take a walk, you want to go cop?
You want to go get some Chinese rock?

[Chorus]
I'm living on a Chinese rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop

[Verse 2]
The plaster's falling off the wall
My girlfriend's crying in the shower stall
It's hot as the bitch, I should've been rich
But I'm just digging a Chinese ditch

[Chorus]
I'm living on a Chinese rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop
Ooh aah, ooh aah

[Verse 3]
The plaster's falling off the wall
My girlfriend's crying in the shower stall
It's hot as the bitch, I should've been rich
But I'm just digging a Chinese ditch

All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop

Danny says we gotta go
Gotta go to Idaho
But we can't go surfing
'Cause it's 20 below

[Verse 2]
Sound check's at 5:02
Record stores and interviews
Oh, but I can't wait
To be with you tomorrow

[Bridge]
Baby
Oh, we got nowhere to go
And it may sound funny, but it's true

[Verse 3]
Hangin' out in 100 B
Watching Get Smart on TV
Thinking about
You and me and you and me

[Verse 4]
Hanging out in L.A
And there's nowhere to go
It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow
Listening to Sheena on the radio[Intro]
This is rock and roll radio, come on; let's rock and roll with the Ramones
Rock and rock and roll radio, let's go
Rock and rock and roll radio, let's go
Rock and rock and roll radio, let's go
Rock and rock and roll radio, let's go

[Verse]
Do you remember Hullabaloo
Upbeat, Shindig and Ed Sullivan too?
Do you remember rock and roll radio?
Do you remember rock and roll radio?
Do you remember Murray the K
Alan Freed, and high energy?
It's the end, the end of the 70's
It's the end, the end of the century
Do you remember lying in bed
With your covers pulled up over your head?
Radio playing so no one can see
We need change, we need it fast
Before rock's just part of the past
Because lately it all sounds the same to me
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh

[Outro]
Will you remember Jerry Lee
John Lennon, T. Rex and OI Moulty?
It's the end, the end of the 70's
It's the end, the end of the century[Verse 1]
Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock 'n' Roll High School

Wondering what I'm doing tonight
I've been in the closet and I feel alright
Ran out of Carbona, Mom threw out the glue
Ran out of paint and roach spray too
It's TV's fault why I am this way
Mom and pop wanna put me away
From the early morning movie to the late, late show
After it's over, nowhere to go

[Chorus]
And I'm not sorry for the things I do
My brain is stuck from shooting glue
I'm not sorry for the things I do
Do
Carbona, not glue
Carbona, not glue

So much their confusion before my eyes
But nothing seems to phase me, and this one still survives

'Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
Well I just want to walk right out of this world

I saw her today, I saw her face, it was a face I loved, and I knew
I had to run away, and get down on my knees and pray that they'd go away
But still they'd begin (uh), needles and pins (uh)
Because of all my pride, the tears I got to hide

[Verse]
Hey I thought I was smart, I'd won her heart
Didn't think I'd do, but now I see
She's worse to him than me, let her go ahead
Take his love instead, and one day she will see
Just how to say please, and get down on her knees
Hey that's how it begins (uh), she'll feel those needles and pins
A-hurting her, a-hurting her
Why can't I stop and tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong
Why can't I stand up and tell myself I'm strong

[Chorus]
Because I saw her today, I saw her face, it was a face I loved, and I knew
I had to run away, and get down on my knees and pray that they'd go away
