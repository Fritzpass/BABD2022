[Intro]
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1]
Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man? Yeah
An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can?
Honey, you know I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And, and each time I tell myself that I, well I think I've had enough
But I'm gonna, gonna show you baby, that a woman can be tough
I want you to come on, come on, come on, come on and take it

[Chorus]
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it
Break another little bit of my heart now, darling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, have a
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Well you know you got it, if it makes you feel good
Oh, yes indeed

[Verse 2]
You're out on the streets looking good
And baby deep down in your heart I guess you know that it ain't right
Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at night
Babe and I cry all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
But each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again
I'll say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it

[Chorus]
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Oh, oh, break it

Have another little piece of my heart now, baby, hey
You know you got it, child, if it makes you feel good[Verse 1]
Live your loving life
Live it all the best you can
And if you pay no attention darling
To what you might ever hear from your man
I think you're just like a servant
And try to keep it all to yourself
Don't you know it makes the world go round
You got to go and honey share everywhere else
Come on, come on, come on!

[Chorus]
As good as you've been to this world
So good I want to be right back to you
As good as you've been now
As good as you've been to this whole wide world
So good I want to be
As good as you've been now, say
As good as you've been to this whole wide world
As good as you've been, babe
So good I want to be here

[Verse 2]
It's no use in being faithful
I see you look at the sky
I know what's in it make you happy there
But it only make you cry
I think you got good intentions too
They don't manage to show through
Whatever you give to the world outside
I want to give it right back to you, yes I am!
Come on, come on, come on!
[Verse 3]
So you meet somebody on the street
You know you treat him mighty fine
Or you meet somebody on the street
And you give him a real hard time
It's gonna come on home baby
I said it's going to come right back home to you
I said it's going to visit you now
Yes it is, oh yes it is

[Chorus]
As good as you've been to this world
So good I want to be right back to you
As good as you've been now
As good as you've been to this whole wide world
So good I want to be
As good as you've been now, say
As good as you've been to this whole wide world
As good as you've been, babe
So good I want to be here

[Bridge]
Good as you've been babe, hurrah!
Good as you've been babe, hey!

Time keeps moving on
Friends they turn away
I keep moving' on
But I never found out why
I keep pushing so hard the dream
I keep trying' to make it right
Through another lonely day, whoa a

Dawn has come at last
Twenty-five years, honey just in one night, oh yeah
Well, I'm twenty-five years older now
So I know we can't be right
And I'm no better, baby
And I can't help you no more
Than I did when just a girl

[Chorus]
Aww, but it don't make no difference, baby, no, no
And I know that I could always try
It don't make no difference, baby, yeah
I better hold it now, I better need it, yeah
I better use it until the day I die, whoa

[Verse 2]
Don't expect any answers, dear
For I know that they don't come with age, no, no
Well, I'm never going to love you any better, babe
And I'm never going to love you right
So you'd better take it now, right now

[Chorus]
Aww, but it don't make no difference, babe
And I know that I could always try
There's a fire inside of everyone of us
You better need it now, I get to hold it, yeah
I better use it until the day I die

[Verse 3]
Don't make no difference, babe, no, no, no
And it never ever will, hey
I want to talk about a little bit of loving, yeah
I get to hold it, baby
I'm going to need it now
I'm going to use it, say, aah

Don't make no difference, babe, yeah
Ah honey, I'd hate to be the one
I said you're going to live your life
And you're going to love your life
Or babe, someday you're going to have to cry
Yes indeed, yes indeed, yes indeed
Ah, baby, yes indeed

I said you, you're always going to hurt me
I said you're always going to let me down
I said everywhere, every day, every day
And every way, every way
Ah honey won't you hold on to what's going to move
I said it's going to disappear when you turn your back
I said you know it isn't going to be there
When you want to reach out and grab on

[Outro]

My unhappy oh little girl, little girl blue, yeah

[Verse]
Oh sit there, oh count those raindrops
Oh, feel them falling down, oh honey all around you
Honey don't you know it's time

Somebody told you because you got to know
That all you ever going to have to count on
Or going to want to lean on

When they're falling down, honey, all around you
Oh, I know you're unhappy

[Chorus]
Oh sit there
Oh go on, go on and count your fingers

Ah my unhappy, my unlucky, and my little poor girl blue
I know you're unhappy
Oh ah hon' I know
Baby I know just how you feel[Verse 1]
Honey, I love to go to parties
And I like to have a good time
But if it gets too pale after a while

[Chorus]
Honey and I start looking to find
One good man
Hmm, don't you know I've been searching
Oh yes, I have
One good man
Oh it isn't much, honey it isn't much
It's only everything, whoa

[Verse 2]
And I don't want much out of life
I never wanted a mansion in the South
I just want to find someone sincere
Who'd treat me like he talks

[Chorus]
Honey and I start looking to find
One good man
Hmm, don't you know I've been searching
Oh yes, I have
One good man
Oh it isn't much, honey it isn't much

Some girls they want to collect their men
They wear them like notches on a gun
Oh honey, but I know better than that

[Chorus]
Honey and I start looking to find
One good man
Hmm, don't you know I've been searching
Oh yes, I have
One good man
Oh it isn't much, honey it isn't much

There's a light, certain kind of light
Never ever, never shone on me, no, no

To be lived with you, babe
That's what I want oh, was to be
Living and loving you

There's a way, oh everybody say
You can do anything, every thing yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But what good, what good
Honey, what good could it ever bring
Because I haven't got you with my love
And I can't find you babe, no I can't

[Chorus]
You don't know, you don't know what it's like
No you don't, honey no you don't know
You don't know what it's like
To love anybody
Oh honey, I want to talk about love
And trying to hold somebody
The way I love you babe
And I've been loving you babe

[Verse 2]
In my brain, oh I can see your face again
I know my frame of mind, yeah
But nobody, nobody has to ever be so blind
Honey, like I did, I know I was blind
Honey, I tell you that I was, I was very, very blind
Oh but I'm just a girl
Can't you just take a look at me and tell
Tell that I live, honey I live and I breathe for you
Don't you know I do!

To love anybody
Oh honey, I want to talk about love
And trying to hold somebody
The way I love you babe
And I've been loving you babe

[Bridge]
Oh, I know that there's a way
Because everybody came to me one time and said
"Honey, you can do anything
Every little thing, and I think I can
Oh, but what good, what good
Honey, what awfully good can it ever, ever bring
Because I can't find you with my love
And I can't find you babe, oh anywhere

So I won't lose, lose, lose him to nobody else
Hey! Well, I don't care how long it's going to take you now
But if it's a dream I don't want, no, I don't really want it
If it's a dream I don't want nobody to wake me

Yeah, I'm going to try yeah, just a little bit harder
So I can give, give, give, give him every bit of my soul
Yeah, I'm going to try yeah, just a little bit harder
So I can show, show, show him love with no control

With no one to love
Though I've looked everywhere
And I can't find me anybody to love
To feel my care

[Chorus]
So ah work me Lord, whoa use me Lord
Don't you know how hard it is
Trying to live all alone
Every day I keep trying to move forward
But something is driving me, oh, back
Honey, something's trying to hold on to me
To my way of life

[Verse]
So don't you forget me down here, Lord
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Ah, ah, don't you forget me, Lord
Well, I don't think I'm any very special
Kind of person down here, I know better
But I don't think you're going to find anybody
Not anybody who could say that they tried like I tried
The worst you can say all about me
Is that I'm never satisfied, Whoa
[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh please, please, oh don't you go and
Forget me down here, don't forget me, Lord
I think that maybe you can ease me
Maybe I can help you, said uh whoa
Oh please, please, don't you go and leave me Lord
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, whoa, whoa please
Hmm please, don't you leave me, Lordnull[Verse]
A woman left lonely will soon grow tired of waiting
She'll do crazy things, yeah, on lonely occasions
A simple conversation for the new men now and again
Makes a touchy situation when a good face come into your head
And when she gets lonely, she's thinking about her man
She knows he's taking her for granted, yeah yeah
Honey, she doesn't understand, no, no, no, no!

Well, the fevers of the night, they burn an unloved woman
Yeah, those red-hot flames try to push old love aside
A woman left lonely, she's the victim of her man, yes she is
When he can't keep up his own way, good Lord
She's got to do the best that she can, yeah
A woman left lonely, Lord, that lonely girl
Lord, Lord, Lord![Instrumental][Chorus]
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

[Verse 1]
I know she told you
Honey I know she told you that she loved you
Much more than I did
But all I know is that she left you
And you swear that you just don't know why
But you know, honey I'll always
I'll always be around if you ever want me

[Chorus]
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

[Verse 2]
Don't you know, honey
Ain't nobody ever going to love you
The way I try to do?
Who'll take all your pain
Honey, your heartache, too?
And if you need me, you know
That I'll always be around if you ever want me

[Chorus]
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

[Verse 3]
And when you walk around the world, babe
You said you'd try to look for the end of the road
You might find out later that the road will end in Detroit
Honey, the road will even end in Kathmandu
You can go all around the world
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby
When you only got to do one thing well
You only got to do one thing well to make it in this world, babe
You got a woman waiting for you there
All you ever got to do is be a good man one time to one woman
And that will be the end of the road, babe
I know you got more tears to share, babe

[Chorus]
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home

[Bridge]
And if you ever feel a little lonely, dear
I want you to come on, come on to your mama now
And if you ever want a little love of a woman

[Chorus]
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Honey, welcome back home[Verse 1]
In this world, if you read the papers, Lord
You know everybody's fighting on with each other
You got no one you can count on, baby
Not even your own brother

[Chorus]
So if someone comes along
He's going to give you some love and affection
I'd say get it while you can, yeah
Honey, get it while you can
Hey, hey, get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love, no, no

[Verse 2]
Don't you know when you're loving anybody, baby
You're taking a gamble on a little sorrow
But then who cares, baby
Because we may not be here tomorrow, no

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, get it while you can
Honey get it when you're going to want to need it dear, yeah yeah
Hey hey, get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love
No no no, no no no no, get it while you can
I said hold on to somebody when you get a little lonely, dear
[Outro]
Hey hey, hold on to that man's heart
Yeah, get it, want it, hold it, need it
Get it, want it, need it, hold it
Get it while you can, yeah
Honey get it while you can, baby, yeah
Hey hey, get it while you can[Pre-Chorus]
Half moon, night time sky
Seven stars, heaven's eyes
Seven songs on seven seas
Just to bring all your sweet love home to me

[Chorus]
Hey, you fill me like the mountains
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You fill me like the sea, Lord
Not coming past but still at last
Your love brings life to me
Your love brings life to me, hey

[Verse]
Rings of cloud and arms aflame
Wings rise up to call your name
Sun rolls high, Lord, it burns the ground
Just to tell about the first good man I found

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus][x2]
[Outro]
Won't you bring life to me
I said you're going to ride around
When I'm on a little home babe
Bring it on home, you bring it on home
Bring it on home, bring it on home
I said your love brings life to me, yeah[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
When I was feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
And rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playing soft while Bobby sung the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slapping time I was holding Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing, I mean nothing, honey if it isn't free, no no
Yeah feeling good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

[Verse 2]
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing, and that's all that Bobby left me
Feeling good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

[Bridge]
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah

La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah

La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah

La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah

[Outro]
Lord, I called him my lover, I called him my man
I said called him my lover just the best I can and come on
And and a Bobby oh, and a Bobby McGee yeah
Lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo
Hey hey hey Bobby McGee, lord
La da la la la, la da la la la la la
Hey hey hey, Bobby McGee yeah[Intro]
I'd like to do a song
Of great social and political import
It goes like this

[Verse 1]
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
So Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz

[Verse 2]
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV
Dialing For Dollars is trying to find me
I wait for delivery each day until three
So oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV

[Verse 3]
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town
I'm counting on you, Lord, please don't let me down
Prove that you love me and buy the next round
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town

[Verse 1]
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
So Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz

Spoken:
That's it!  (cackle)You say that it's over baby, Lord
You say that it's over now
But still you hang around me, come on
Won't you move over

You know that I need a man, honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can

Please don't you do it to me babe, no!
Please don't you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be

I'm not quite ready for walking, no no no no
I'm not quite ready for walking
And what are you going to do with your life
Life all just dangling?

Oh yeah, make up your mind, honey
You're playing with me, hey hey hey
Make up your mind, darling
You're playing with me, come on now!
Now either be my loving man
I said let me honey, let me be, yeah!

You say that it's over baby, Lord
You say that it's over now
But still you hang around me, come on
Won't you move over

You know that I need a man, honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can

Please don't you do it to me babe, no!
Please don't you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be

I said won't you, won't you let me be?
Honey, you're teasing me
Yeah, you're playing with my heart, dear
I believe you're toying with my affections, honey

I can't take it no more baby
And furthermore, I don't intend to
I'm just tired of hanging from the end of a string, honey
You expect me to fight like a goddamned mule
Wah, wah, wah, wah, honey[Verse 1]
And when I work hard all day long
I tell you what, it don't bother me nohow
Because how could anything ever go wrong

[Chorus]
When I got my baby, Lord, yes
When I got my baby, oh Lord!

[Verse 2]
And when they tell me love is pain
I said it might be true for you, honey
But not for Janis no more, no no no no
All I've ever got to do is call my daddy's name

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Honey, I want to tell you something that I do
Deep down, honey, in the dark of the night
When I lay my head down, I want to go to sleep
And I know everything is going to be alright

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
And when I want to call the names
Or the things to be that want to be to you
And when I want to reach out my hand
It always seems you hold me, dear
Love, don't you know how long I looked for you
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Love, don't you know how hard I tried
[Chorus][Verse 1]
Trust in me, baby, give me time, give me time, um give me time
I heard somebody say, oh, "The older the grape
Sweeter the wine, sweeter the wine"

[Chorus]
Oh, my love is like a seed, baby, just needs time to grow
It's growing stronger day by day, yeah
That's the price you've got to pay

[Verse 2]
Trust in me, baby, give me time, gimme time, please, a little more time
Takes a road runner just a little bit longer, dear
Oh, to make up my mind, I got to make up my mind

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got know, know that I'm ready, oh ready to settle down
Because I think too much of your loving, baby
Yeah, I don't want to mess your life around

So if you love me like you tell me that you're doing, dear
You shouldn't mind paying the price, any price, any price
Love is supposed to be that special kind of thing
Make anybody want to sacrifice

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Trust in me baby, trust in me baby
Trust in my love, in my heart
Keep the faith, baby, keep the faith in me, dear, in my love
Don't turn your face away from me, dear, oh you leave a lost girl
Oh, don't turn your love away, no no no no no no no
You've got to believe in me, baby, yeah, trust me dear, oh
