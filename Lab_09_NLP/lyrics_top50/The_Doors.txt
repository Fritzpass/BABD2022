Lions in the street and roaming
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town

He went down South and crossed the border
Left chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder

One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shining skin
Is everybody in?
Is everybody in?
Is everybody in?
The ceremony is about to begin

Wake up!
You can't remember where it was
Had this dream stopped?

The snake was pale gold
Glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisons
And she was beside me
Old, she's no, young
Her dark white hair
The white soft skin

Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look!
Shes coming in here
I can't live thru each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down
The cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain

Once I had, a little game
I liked to crawl, back in my brain
I think you know, the game I mean
I mean the game, called 'go insane'

You should try, this little game
Just close your eyes, forget your name
Forget the world, forget the people
And we'll erect, a different steeple

This little game, is fun to do
Just close your eyes, no way to lose
And I'm right there, I'm going too
Release control, we're breaking thru

Way back deep into the brain
Back where there's never any pain
And the rain falls gently on the town
And over the heads of all of us
And in the labyrinth of streams
Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of
Gentle hill dwellers, in the gentle hills around
Reptiles abounding
Fossils, caves, cool air heights

Each house repeats a mold
Windows rolled
Beast car locked in against morning
All now sleeping
Rugs silent, mirrors vacant
Dust Lying under the beds of lawful couples
Wound in sheets
And daughters, smug
With semen eyes in their nipples

Wait
There's been a slaughter here

(Don't stop to speak or look around
Your gloves and fan are on the ground
We're getting out of town
We're going on the run
And you're the one I want to come)

Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do, but
Run, run, run
Let's run
Lets run

House upon the hill
Moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
C'mon baby run with me
Let's run

Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside

Dead president's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
C'mon along, we're not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar

Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl! We're almost home

We should see the gates by mornin'
We should be inside by evening

Sun sun sun
Burn burn burn
MOON, MOON, MOON
I will get you
Soon
Soon
Soon

I am the lizard king
I can do anything

We came down
The rivers and highways
We came down from
Forests and falls

We came down from
Carson and Springfield
We came down from
Phoenix enthralled
And I can tell you
The names of the Kingdom
I can tell you
The things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade

For seven years, I dwelt
In the loose palace of exile
Playing strange games with the girls of the island
Now, i have come again
To the land of the fair, and the strong, and the wise
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
Children of night
Who among you will run with the hunt?
Now night arrives with her purple legion
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth
I want to be ready'[Chorus]
Well, I've been down so Goddamn long
That it looks like up to me
Well, I've been down so very damn long
That it looks like up to me
Yeah, why don't one you people
Come on and set me free

[Verse]
I said, warden, warden, warden
Won't you break your lock and key
I said, warden, warden, warden
Won't ya break your lock and key
Yeah, come along here Mister
C'mon and let the poor boy be

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby
Won't you get down on your knees
Baby, baby, baby
Won't you get down on your knees
C'mon little darlin'
C'mon and give your love to me, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Well, I've been down so Goddamn long
That it looks like up to me
Well, I've been down so very damn long
That it looks like up to me
Yeah, why don't one you people
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon and set me free[Verse]
The cars hiss by my window
Like the waves down on the beach
The cars hiss by my window
Like the waves down on the beach
I got this girl beside me
But she's out of reach
Headlight through my window
Shinin' on the wall
Headlight through my window
Shinin' on the wall
Can't hear my baby
Though I called and called
Windows started tremblin'
With a sonic boom
Windows started tremblin'
With a sonic boom, boom
A cold girl'll kill you
In a darkened room

[Outro]
[Jim Morrison impersonating a guitar/harmonica][Intro]
What are they doing in the Hyacinth House?
What are they doing in the Hyacinth House?
To please the lions, yeah
This day

[Verse]
I need a brand new friend who doesn't bother me
I need a brand new friend who doesn't trouble me
I need someone, yeah
Who doesn't need me
I see the bathroom is clear
I think that somebody's here
I'm sure that someone is following me, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Why did you throw the Jack of Hearts away?
Why did you throw the Jack of Hearts away?
It was the only card in the deck that I had left to play

[Outro]
And I'll say it again, I need a brand new friend [x3]
The end[Verse: Jim Morrison]
Well, I just got into town about an hour ago
Took a look around, see which way the wind blow
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows
Are you a lucky little lady in the City of Light?
Or just another lost angel?
City of Night, City of Night
City of Night, City of Night
L.A. woman, L.A. woman
L.A. woman, Sunday afternoon
L.A. woman, Sunday afternoon
L.A. woman, Sunday afternoon
Drive through your suburbs
Into your blues, into your blues, yeah
Into your blues, into your blues!

I see your hair is burning
Hills are filled with fire
If they say I never loved you
You know they are a liar
Driving down your freeways
Midnight alleys roam
Cops in cars, the topless bars
Never saw a woman so alone
So alone, so alone, so alone
Motel money murder-madness
Let's change the mood from glad to sadness
[Outro]

Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone, an actor out on loan
Riders on the storm

[Verse 1]
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride, sweet family will die
Killer on the road

Girl you gotta love your man
Girl you gotta love your man
Take him by the hand
Make him understand
The world on you depends, our life will never end

I wanna tell you 'bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Comes out of the Virginia swamps
Cool and slow with deadly precision
With a back beat narrow and hard to master

[Verse]
Some call it heavenly in its brilliance
Others, mean and rueful of the Western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
This is the land where the Pharaoh die
The Negroes in the forest brightly feathered
They are saying, Forget the night
Live with us in forests of azure
Out here on the perimeter there are no stars
Out here we is stoned - immaculate
Listen to this, and I'll tell you 'bout the heartache
I'll tell you 'bout the heartache and the loss of God
I'll tell you 'bout the hopeless night
The meager food for souls forgot
I'll tell you 'bout the maiden with wrought iron soul
I'll tell you this
No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn
I'll tell you 'bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Soft driving, slow and mad, like some new language
Now, listen to this, and I'll tell you about the Texas
I'll tell you about the Texas Radio
I'll tell you 'bout the hopeless night
Wandering the Western dream
Tell you about the maiden with wrought iron soul{Intro}

I found my own true love was
On a blue Sunday
She looked at me and told me
I was the only
One in the world
Now I have found my girl

My girl awaits for me in tender time

(She came) Blood in the streets it's up to my knee
(She came) Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago
(She came) Blood on the rise it's following me
Think about the break of day
She came and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair

(She came) Blood in the streets runs a river of sadness
(She came) Blood in the streets it's up to my thigh
(She came) Yeah the river runs red down the legs of a city
(She came) The women are crying red rivers of weepin'
She came in town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair

Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind

Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of fantastic L.A

Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union

There's blood in the streets it's up to my ankles
Blood in the streets it's up to my knee
Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago
Blood on the rise it's following meShe was a princess
Queen of the highway
Sign on the road said:
"Take us to Madre"
No one could save her
Save the blind tiger
He was a monster
Black dressed in leather
She was a princess
Queen of the Highway

Now they are wedded
She is a good girl
Naked as children
Out in a meadow
Naked as children
Wild as can be
Soon to have offspring
Start it all over
Start it all over

We raced down to the sea
Standing there on freedom's shore
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun

Can't you feel it
Now that Spring has come
That it's time to live in the scattered sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun

Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting for you to come along
Waiting for you to hear my song
Waiting for you to come along
Waiting for you to tell me what went wrong
This is the strangest life I've ever known

Can't you feel it
Now that Spring has come
That it's time to live in the scattered sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sunWhen the still sea conspires an armor
And her sullen and aborted
Currents breed tiny monsters
True sailing is dead!

Awkward instant
And the first animal is jettisoned
Legs furiously pumping
Their stiff green gallop
And heads bob up
Poise
Delicate
Pause
Consent
In mute nostril agony
Carefully refined
And sealed over[Verse 1]

City sleeps to hide
Let's swim out tonight, love
It's our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon, uh huh
Let's climb through the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds
That lap against our side
Nothing left open
And no time to decide
We've stepped into a river
On our moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
You reach your hand to hold me
But I can't be your guide
Easy, I love you
As I watch you glide
Falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive, baby
Moonlight drive

Down, down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close
Get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight

And we're on our way
No we can't turn back, babe
Yeah, we're on our way
And we can't turn back, yeah

C'mon, yeah!

[Bridge]
I walked with you
You walked with me
I talked to you
You talked to me
[Pre-Chorus]
And we're on our way
No we can't turn back, babe
Yeah, we're on our way
And we can't turn back

[Chorus]
Because it's too late
Too late, too late
Too late, too late

[Pre-Chorus]
And we're on our way
No we can't turn back, babe
Yeah, we're on our way
And we can't turn back

[Chorus]
Because it's too late
Too late, too late
Too late, too late[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

[Verse 2]
The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Yeah...

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire

[Outro][Verse 1]
Well, the clock says it's time to close now
I guess I'd better go now
I'd really like to stay here all night
The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes
Street lights shed their hollow glow
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise
Still one place to go
Still one place to go

[Chorus]
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves

[Verse 2]
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets
Speak in secret alphabets
I light another cigarette
Learn to forget, learn to forget
Learn to forget, learn to forget

[Chorus]
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
[Outro]
Well the clock says it's time to close now
I know I have to go now
I really want to stay here
All night, all night, all night[Verse 1]
Time to live
Time to lie
Time to laugh
Time to die

[Chorus]
Takes it easy, baby
Take it as it comes
Don't move too fast
And you want your love to last
Oh, you've been moving much too fast

[Verse 2]
Time to walk
Time to run
Time to aim your arrows
At the sun

[Chorus]
Takes it easy, baby
Take it as it comes
Don't move too fast
And you want your love to last
Oh, you've been moving much too fast
[Verse 3]
Go real slow
You like it more and more
Take it as it comes
Specialize in having fun

[Chorus]
Takes it easy, baby
Take it as it comes
Don't move too fast
And you want your love to last
Oh, you've been moving much too fast

[Outro]
Moving much too fast
Moving much too fast[Verse 1]
Before you slip into unconsciousness
I'd like to have another kiss
Another flashing chance at bliss
Another kiss, another kiss

[Verse 2]
The days are bright and filled with pain
Enclose me in your gentle rain
The time you ran was too insane
We'll meet again, we'll meet again

[Verse 3]
Oh tell me where your freedom lies
The streets are fields that never die
Deliver me from reasons why
You'd rather cry, I'd rather fly

[Verse 4]
The crystal ship is being filled
A thousand girls, a thousand thrills
A million ways to spend your time
When we get back, I'll drop a line[Intro]

[Chorus]
This is the end
Beautiful friend
This is the end
My only friend, the end

[Verse 1]
Of our elaborate plans, the end
Of everything that stands, the end
No safety or surprise, the end
I'll never look into your eyes again

[Verse 2]
Can you picture what will be?
So limitless and free
Desperately in need
Of some stranger's hand
In a desperate land

[Verse 3]
Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain
And all the children are insane
All the children are insane
Waiting for the summer rain, yeah

[Verse 4]
There's danger on the edge of town
Ride the King's Highway, baby
Weird scenes inside the gold mine
Ride the highway west, baby
Ride the snake, ride the snake
To the lake, the ancient lake, baby
The snake, he's long, seven miles
Ride the snake
He's old and his skin is cold
The west is the best
The west is the best
Get here and we'll do the rest
The blue bus is calling us
The blue bus is calling us
Driver, where you taking us?

[Verse 5]
The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he
He walked on down the hall, and
And he came to a door
And he looked inside
"Father?" "Yes, son?" "I want to kill you"
"Mother? I want to..."

[Bridge]
Come on baby, take a chance with us
Come on baby, take a chance with us
Come on baby, take a chance with us
And meet me at the back of the blue bus
Of the blue bus, on the blue bus, on the blue bus
Come on yeah
Fuck, fuck-ah, yeah
Fuck, fuck
Fuck, fuck
Fuck, fuck, fuck yeah!
Come on baby, come on baby
Fuck me baby, fuck yeah
Woah
Fuck, fuck, fuck, yes!
Fuck, yeah, come on baby
Fuck me baby, fuck fuck
Woah, woah, woah, yeah
Fuck yeah, do it, yeah
Come on!
Huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah
Alright
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill

[Chorus]
This is the end
Beautiful friend
This is the end
My only friend, the end

[Verse 6]
It hurts to set you free
But you'll never follow me
The end of laughter and soft lies
The end of nights we tried to die
This is the end[Verse 1]
Well, she's fashionably lean
And she's fashionably late
She'll never rank a scene
She'll never break a date
But she's no drag
Just watch the way she walks

[Chorus]
She's a twentieth century fox
She's a twentieth century fox
No tears, no fears
No ruined years, no clocks
She's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
She's the queen of cool
And she's the lady who waits
Since her mind left school
It never hesitates
She won't waste time
On elementary talk

[Chorus]
Cause she's a twentieth century fox
She's a twentieth century fox
Got the world locked up
Inside a plastic box
She's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah
Twentieth century fox, oh yeah
Twentieth century fox
She's a twentieth century fox[Intro]
There will never be
Another one like you
There will never be
Another one who can
Do the things you do, oh

[Chorus]
Will you give another chance?
Will you try, little try?
Please stop and you remember
We were together, anyway, all right

[Verse 1]
And if you have a certain evening
You could lend to me
I'd give it all right back to you
A how it has to be with you
I know your moves and your mind
And your mind[x6]
Will you stop and think and wonder?
Just what you'll see
Out on the train yard
Nursing penitentiary
It's gone, I cry out long
Go head, brother
Did you stop it to consider?
How it will feel
Cold, grinding grizzly bear jaws
Hot on your heels
Do you often stop and whisper?
It's Saturday's shore
The whole world's a savior
Who could ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever
Ask for more?
Do you remember?
Will you stop?
Will you stop?
The pain
And there will never be
Another one like you
There will never be
Another one who can
Do the things you do, oh

[Chorus]
Will you give another chance?
Will you try, little try?
Please stop and you remember
We were together, anyway, all right

[Verse 2]
How you must of think and wondered
How I must feel
Out on the meadows
While you run the field
I'm alone for you
And I cry
The sweat, look at it
Optical promise
Heh, heh, heh
You'll be dead and in hell
Before I'm born
Sure thing
Brides maid
The only solution
Isn't it amazing?[Chorus]
Tell all the people that you see
Follow me
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Set them free
Follow me down

[Verse]
You tell them they don't have to run
We're going to pick up everyone
Come out and take me by my hand
Going to bury all our troubles in the sand, oh yeah
Can't you see the wonder at your feet
Your life's complete
Follow me down
Can't you see me growing, get your guns
The time has come
To follow me down
Follow me across the sea
Where milky babies seem to be
Molded, flowing revelry
With the one that set them free

[Bridge]
Tell all the people that you see
It's just me
Follow me down

[Chorus]
Tell all the people that you see
Follow me
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
We'll be free
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
It's just me
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Follow me
Follow me down

[Outro]
Follow me down
You've got to follow me down
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
We'll be free
Follow me down
Tell all the people you see
Follow me
Got to follow me downWhen I was back there in seminary school
There was a person there
Who put forth the proposition
That you can petition the Lord with prayer
Petition the lord with prayer
Petition the lord with prayer
You cannot petition the lord with prayer!

Can you give me sanctuary
I must find a place to hide
A place for me to hide

Can you find me soft asylum
I can't make it anymore
The Man is at the door

Peppermint, miniskirts, chocolate candy
Champion sax and a girl named Sandy
There's only four ways to get unraveled
One is to sleep and the other is travel, da da
One is a bandit up in the hills
One is to love your neighbor 'till
His wife gets home

Catacombs
Nursery bones
Winter women
Growing stones
Carrying babies
To the river

Streets and shoes
Avenues
Letter writers
Selling news
The monk bought lunch

Ha ha, he bought a little
Yes, he did
Woo!
This is the best part of the trip
This is the trip, the best part
I really like
What'd he say?
Yeah!
Yeah, right!
Pretty good, huh
Huh!
Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number

Successful hills are here to stay
Everything must be this way
Gentle streets where people play
Welcome to the Soft Parade

All our lives we sweat and save
Building for a shallow grave
Must be something else we say
Somehow to defend this place
Everything must be this way
Everything must be this way, yeah

The Soft Parade has now begun
Listen to the engines hum
People out to have some fun
A cobra on my left
Leopard on my right, yeah

The deer woman in a silk dress
Girls with beads around their necks
Kiss the hunter of the green vest
Who has wrestled before
With lions in the night

Out of sight!
The lights are getting brighter
The radio is moaning
Calling to the dogs
There are still a few animals
Left out in the yard
But it's getting harder
To describe sailors
To the underfed

Tropic corridor
Tropic treasure
What got us this far
To this mild equator?

We need someone or something new
Something else to get us through, yeah, come on

Calling on the dogs
Calling on the dogs
Oh, it's getting harder
Calling on the dogs
Calling in the dogs
Calling all the dogs
Calling on the gods

You got to meet me
Too late, baby
Slay a few animals
At the crossroads
Too late
All in the yard
But it's getting harder
By the crossroads
You got to meet me
Oh, we're going, we're going great
At the edge of town
Tropic corridor
Tropic treasure
Having a good time
Got to come along
What got us this far
To this mild equator?
Outskirts of the city
You and I
We need someone new
Something new
Something else to get us through
Better bring your gun
Better bring your gun
Tropic corridor
Tropic treasure
We're going to ride and have some fun

When all else fails
We can whip the horse's eyes
And make them sleep
And cry[Intro]

[Verse]
Yeah! Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?

[Hook]
Now, I'm going to love you
Till the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I

[Verse]
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?

[Hook]
Now, I'm going to love you
Till the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and  I

I'm going to love you
Till the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I

[Sax Solo]

[Outro]
Stronger than dirt[Intro]
All right

[Chorus]
Wild child full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face

[Bridge]
Natural child, terrible child
Not your mother's or your father's child
Your our child, screaming wild
An ancient lunatic reins
In the trees of the night
Ha, ha, ha, ha

[Verse]
With hunger at her heels
Freedom in her eyes
She dances on her knees
Pirate prince at her side
Staring into the hollow idol’s eye

[Chorus]
Wild child full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face[x3]
[Outro]
Do you remember when we were in Africa?[Intro]
Yeah, c'mon
I love my girl
She lookin' good
C'mon
One more

[Verse 1]
Five to one, baby
One in five
No one here gets out alive, now
You get yours, baby
I'll get mine
Gonna make it, baby
If we try

The old get old
And the young get stronger
May take a week
And it may take longer
They got the guns
But we got the numbers
Gonna win, yeah
We're takin' over
Come on!
Your ballroom days are over, baby
Night is drawing near
Shadows of the evening
Crawl across the years

Ya walk across the floor with a flower in your hand
Trying to tell me no one understands
Trade in your hours for a handful of dimes
Gonna' make it, baby, in our prime

[Chorus]
Come together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together, aha
Get together one more time!
Get together one more time!
Get together one more time!
Get together one more time!
Get together one more time!
Get together, got to, get together

Ooaaaaaah!

[Bridge]
Hey, c'mon, honey
You won't have a long wait for me, baby
I'll be there in just a little while
You see, I gotta go out in this car with these people and...
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together, got to
Get together, got to
Get together, got to
Take you up in my room and
Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah
Love my girl
She looking good, looking real good
Love you, come on[Chorus]
Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game

[Verse 1]
She's walking down the street
Blind to every eye she meets
Do you think you'll be the guy
To make the queen of the angels sigh?

[Chorus]
Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game

[Verse 2]
She holds her head so high
Like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long
When she moves my brain screams out this song

Sidewalk crouches at her feet
Like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

[Outro]
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello
I want you
Hello
I need my baby
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello...[Chorus]
She lives on Love Street
Lingers long on Love Street
She has a house and garden
I would like to see what happens

[Verse 1]
She has robes and she has monkeys
Lazy diamond studded flunkies
She has wisdom and knows what to do
She has me and she has you

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
She has wisdom and knows what to do
She has me and she has you

[Verse 2]
I see you live on Love Street
There's this store where the creatures meet
I wonder what they do in there
Summer Sunday and a year
I guess I like it fine, so far

[Chorus]
She lives on Love Street
Lingers long on Love Street
She has a house and garden
I would like to see what happens

[Outro]
La la, la, la-la-la-la
La la, la, la-la-la-la
La la, la, la-la-la-la
La la, la, la-la-la-la...[Verse]
My wild love went riding
She rode all the day
She wrote to the devil
And asked him to pay
The devil was wiser
It's time to repent
He asked her to give back
The money she spent
My wild love went riding
She rode to the sea
She gathered together
Some shells for her head
She rode and she rode on
She rode for a while
Then stopped for an evening
And lay her head down
She rode on to Christmas
She rode to the farm
She rode to Japan
And we entered a town
By this time the river
Had changed one degree
She asked for the people
To let her go free
My wild love is crazy
She screams like a bird
She moans like a cat
When she wants to be heard
My wild love went riding
She rode for an hour
She rode and she rested
And then she rode on
Ride, come on[Intro]
Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do, but
Run, run, run
Let's run

Let's run

[Verse 1]
House upon the hill
Moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
Come on baby run with me
Let's run

[Chorus]
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

[Verse 2]
The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside
Dead president's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
Come on along, not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar

Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

[Bridge]
Whoa!

[Verse 3]
Some outlaws lived by the side of a lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl, we're almost home
Ya, come on!

[Bridge]
We should see the gates by morning
We should be inside the evening
Sun, sun, sun
Burn, burn, burn
Soon, soon, soon
Moon, moon, moon
I will get you
Soon!
Soon!
Soon!
[Outro]
I am the Lizard King
I can do anything[Verse 1]
Carry me Caravan take me away
Take me to Portugal, take me to Spain
Andalusia with fields full of grain
I have to see you again and again
Take me, Spanish Caravan
Yes, I know you can

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Trade winds find Galleons lost in the sea
I know where treasure is waiting for me
Silver and gold in the mountains of Spain
I have to see you again and again
Take me, Spanish Caravan
Yes, I know you can[Instrument break]

[Chorus]
Summer's almost gone
Summer's almost gone
Almost gone
Yeah, it's almost gone
Where will we be
When the summer's gone?

[Verse 1]
Morning found us calmly unaware
Noon burned gold into our hair
At night, we swim the laughin' sea
When summer's gone
Where will we be
Where will we be
Where will we be

Morning found us calmly unaware
Noon burned gold into our hair
At night, we swim the laughin' sea
When summer's gone
Where will we be

[Chorus]
Summer's almost gone
Summer's almost gone
We had some good times
But they're gone
The winter's coming on
Summer's almost gone[Intro]
Wait until the war is over
And we're both a little older
The unknown soldier

[Chorus]
Breakfast where the news is read
Television, children fed
Unborn living, living dead
Bullet strikes the helmet's head

[Verse 1]
And it's all over for the unknown soldier
It's all over for the unknown soldier, uh uh

March!
Company, halt!
Present arms!

Make a grave for the unknown soldier
Nestled in your hollow shoulder
The unknown soldier

[Chorus]
Breakfast where the news is read
Television, children fed
Bullet strikes the helmet's head

[Bridge]
And it's all over
The war is over
It's all over
War is over

[Outro]
It's all over, baby!
All over, baby!
Oh all right, yeah!
All over, yeah ha ha!
All over!
All over, baby!
Oh, oh yeah!
All over
All over
Yeah[Chorus]
Please believe me
The river told me
Very softly
Want you to hold me, hou-hou-hou

[Verse 1]
Free fall flow, river flow
On and on it goes
Breathe under water till the end

Free fall flow, river flow
On and on it goes
Breathe under water till the end
Yes, the river knows

[Bridge]
Please believe me
If you don't need me
I'm going but I need a little time
I promised I would drown myself in mystic heated wine

Please believe me
The river told me
Very softly
Want you to hold me, hou-hou-hou
[Bridge]
I'm going but I need a little time
I promised I would drown myself in mystic heated wine

[Verse 2]
Free fall flow, river flow
On and on it goes
Breathe under water till the end
Free fall flow, river flow
On and on it goes
Breathe under water till the end
