[Verse 1]
Your butt is mine, gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
Shamone, Shamone
Lay it on me, all right
I'm giving you on count of three
To show your stuff or let it be
I'm telling you just watch your mouth
I know your game what you're about

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait til I get through

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone)
You know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?

[Verse 2]
The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones to hide your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait til I get through

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone)
You know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?

[Organ Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm saying
Then won't you slap my face?

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it, you know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad

You know it (Really, really bad)
You know it, you know, you know, you know (Really, really bad)
You know, shamone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I move, I'm bad, you know it (really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know (Really, really bad)
Shamone, You know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it (really, really bad)
You know I'm bad
You know, woo! (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it (really, really bad)
You know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?[Intro]
I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much

[Verse 1: Michael &amp; Siedah]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
[Chorus: Both &amp; Siedah]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael &amp; Siedah &amp; Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael &amp; Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
[Bridge: Michael &amp; Siedah &amp; Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Without you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do[Intro]
Aaow!
Hoo-hoo!

[Verse 1]
I don't care what you talkin' 'bout, baby
I don't care what you say
Don't you come walking begging back, mama
I don't care anyway
Time after time I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb baby
All is going my way

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughing, baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughing, baby?

[Chorus]
So just leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone–stop it!
Just stop dogging me around (just stop dogging me)
[Verse 2]
There was a time I used to say "Girl, I need you"
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now who is sorry now?
You got a way of making me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walking, begging, I ain’t loving you
Don't you get in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughing, baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughing, baby?

[Chorus]
So just leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone–stop it!
Just stop dogging me around

[Pre-Chorus]
(There's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughing, baby? Don't you know, girl
(There's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughing, baby?
[Chorus]
So just leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone–stop it!
Just stop dogging me
Leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone–stop it!
Just stop dogging me around

[Verse 1]
Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

[Chorus]
The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

[Verse 2]
I like the feeling you're giving me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be working from 9 to 5
To buy you things to keep you by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
I've never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
Cause you're the one for me

[Chorus]
The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet

[Interlude 1]
Acha-ooh!

I've never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
Cause you're the one for me

[Chorus]
The way you make me feel

You really turn me on

Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
(You really turn me on)
Hee-hee!

We're taking over
We have the truth
This is the mission
To see it through
Don't point your finger
Not dangerous
This is our planet
You're one of us

[Chorus]
We're sending out
A major love
And this is our
Message to you (Message to you)
The planets are linin' up
We're bringing brighter days
They're all in line
Waiting for you, can't you see?
You're just another part of me

[Verse 2]
A revelation
Fulfill the truth
The final message
We'll bring to you
There is no danger
Fulfill the truth
So come together
We need you

[Outro]
We're taking over
This is the truth, baby
Another part of me[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need."
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: "There's no turning back."
She trapped me in her heart

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star."
[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

[Interlude]
Diana

Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, yeah, yeah
C'mon!

[Verse 3]
She said: "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said: "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright."
Diana walked up to me
She said: "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright."
I said: "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key."
She said: "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me."
[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
See the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
[Extended Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!
[Outro]
Woo, woo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana) woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, Shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, woo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, Shamone, Shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah) stand up (Make that change) stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Ow! (Yeah, make that change)
Make that change, Shamone (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)

Make that change![Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?

Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

A Smooth Criminal

[Verse 2]
So they came in to the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Post-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

[Refrain]
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A Smooth Criminal

[Interlude]
Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!

[Outro]
Annie, are you okay? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie (Dag gone it)
Annie are you okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
There's a sound at the window (Dag gone it-baby)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment, (Dag gone it)
Left bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down (Dag gone it)
It was your doom Annie[Intro]

Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me)

[Verse 2]
Ben, you are always running here and there
(Here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere)
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)

I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
[Verse 4]
Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I am sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
(A friend)
Like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben[Verse 1]
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
I know This place is doomed
Because now it's haunting me

[Bridge]
I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it!
Aaow

[Verse 2]
There's a tapping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughing and a yawning
Where a restless soul is going

[Bridge]
Don't understand it
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
Hey!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Don't understand it
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
Hey!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)

[Chorus 1]
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to shame my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy

[Verse 3]
There's a tapping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling
[Bridge]
Don't understand it!
(Gotta ghost gotta break in the walls)
Yeah Yeah!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Don't understand it!
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
You’re just a dog gone!
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Aaow!

[Chorus 2]
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion
To see me?

[Chorus 1]
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aaow!

[Chorus 2]
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby
She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion
To see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to scare my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me!

But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?[Verse 1]
She got your number, ah
She know your game, ah
She put you under, ah
It's so insane, ah
Since you seduced her, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know that woman, ah
Is out to kill

[Refrain]
Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

[Pre-Chorus]
To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

[Chorus]
Susie got your number and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number and Susie says it's right

[Verse 2]
She got your number, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know this stranger, ah
Is about to kill, ah
She got yo' baby, ah
It happened fast, ah
If you could only, ah
Erase the past (Ah)

[Refrain]
Every night stance is like taking a chances (Ah)
It's not about love and romance
And now you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

[Pre-Chorus]
To escape the world, I got to enjoy this simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

[Chorus]
Susie got your number and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie got your number, you know Susie says it's right (Hoo-hoo)

[Chorus]
Susie's got your number
Susie ain’t your friend (Ah, it's goin' down, baby)
Look who took you under, she put seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife (It's goin' down, baby)
Susie's got your number (Ah)
Susie says it's right

[Outro]
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it
Hoo![Skit]
Hey!
What?
Turn that off!
Dad, this is the best part!
Turn it off!
No!
It’s too late for this, turn it off!
Dad, this is the best part, come on!
No, turn it off now!
No, this is the, I want to listen to it, okay?
You’ve got things to do tomorrow
Yeah, right. Too late. Sure. Eat this

[Verse 1]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Verse 2]
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Bridge]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Rap: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Verse 3]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Outro]
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white[Spoken Intro]
The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
She said don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone
[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch
A kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return

Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
[Verse 2]
I never knew
But I was living in vain
She called my house
She said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

[Alternate Chorus]
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine
[Bridge]
I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby

[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
Cause it's dangerous

[Chorus]
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

[Alternate Chorus]
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

[Ad Libs Out][Verse 1]
She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

[Verse 2]
You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want It
Taking me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me
[Bridge]
You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's okay and it's okay
You won't be laughing girl when I'm not around
I'll be okay
And I'd, I'd never find
Better, a peace of mind, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to tell me
Because your words just aren't enough

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want It
Taking me higher
Talk to me, woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me, give in to me, give in to me

[Chorus]
Oh, love is a feeling
I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire
Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me, give in to me
[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna hear it
Give in to the fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
I'd like a lady
Talk to me baby
Give in to me
Give in to the fire
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Love is a woman
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
'Cause I'm on fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
Give in to the feeling[Intro: Child]
Think about the generations and say that we want to make it a better place for our children, and our children's children, so that they know it's a better world for them
And think, if they can make it a better place...

[Verse 1]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you will feel there's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
[Verse 2]
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
To make a better world

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Bridge]
And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life?
Would this Earth crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow
[Verse 3]
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into
Ploughshares

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
[Post-Chorus]
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Outro: Michael Jackson &amp; Child]
Make a better place (You and for me)
Make a better place (You and for me)
Make a better place (You and for me)
(You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children[Prelude]
Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen?
Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?
Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt
Über Sternen muss er wohnen

[Verse 1]
Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

[Verse 2]
Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human
[Verse 3]
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show it to me?
That you'll be there for me and care enough to bear me

[Verse 4: Michael Jackson &amp; Cleveland Orchestra]
Hold me
Show me
Lay your head lowly
Told me
Softly then boldly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human
Lead me
Hold me
Love me and feed me
Yeah, yeah
Kiss me and free me
Yeah
I will feel blessed
I'm only human
Carry
Carry
Carry me boldly
Carry me
Lift me up slowly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human!
Save me
Lift me
Heal me and bathe me
Lift me up, lift me up
Softly you say to me
I will be there
I will be there
Lift me
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly
Yeah
Show me you care
Hold me
Hoo!
Lay your head lowly
It gets lonely sometimes
I get lonely, yeah, yeah
Softly then boldly
Carry me there
Need me
Hoo!
Love me and feed me
Lift me up, hold me up
Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed
[Spoken]
In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart[Spoken Intro: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
There is something
I have to say to you
If you promise you'll
Understand
I cannot contain myself
When in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me
Don't hide our love
Woman to man

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
She's just a lover
Who's doing me by
It's worth the giving
It's worth the try
You cannot cleave it
Or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it
You cannot burn it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
It's just a feeling
You have to soothe it
You can't neglect it
You can't abuse it
It's just desire
You cannot waste it
Then, if you want it
Then, won't you taste it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it

[Pre-Chorus: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust, woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move
Set me free
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow, to just
Keep it in the closet

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson + Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
If you can get it
It is worth a try
I really want it
I can't deny
It's just desire
I really love it
'Cause if it's aching
You have to rub it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)

[Verse 4: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there
Make the move
Cast the spell

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we'll make a vow, to just
Keep it in the closet

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
There's something about you baby
That makes me want

Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

Ahh, she wants to give it[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

[Bridge]
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time?
(Cause I remember)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)

[Breakdown]
(Remember the time)
Hoo!
(Remember the time)
Do you remember, girl?
(Remember the time)
On the phone, you and me
(Remember the time)
Till dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach
(Remember the time)
You and me, in Spain
What about, what about
(Remember the time)
Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat
Grrrrrat, tat tat
(Remember the time)
Hoo! In the park
(Remember the time)
After dark, do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you, did you?
(Remember the time)
Yeah, yeah, hoo!
(Remember the time, remember the time)[Verse 1]
I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can’t take this stuff no more

[Verse 2]
I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do
[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Tell me, I'm bothered!
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely
[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Can't take it cause I'm lonely)[Verse 1]
What about sunrise?
What about rain?
What about all the things that you said we were to gain?
What about killing fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the things that you said was yours and mine?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?

[Chorus]
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

[Verse 2]
What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done

Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
(Overlapping voices)

[Verse 1]
Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Verse 2]
Beat me, hate me, you can never break me

Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

[Verse 3]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black male, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no
[Verse 4]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Bridge]
Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 5]
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food

This time around I never get bit
Though you really want to fix me
This time around you're making me sick
Though you really want to get me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
You really want to fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm taking no shit
Though you really want to get me, you really want to get me

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
This time around I'm not going to get bit
Though you really want to get me
But this time around I'm taking no shit
Though you really want to fix me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
You really want to use me and falsely accuse me
This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Listen, I got problems of my own
Flashing cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missing, maybe it could be
My friends, but they ain’t friends if they robbing me
Stopping me, from making a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smoking
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'ma kill a nigga, I ain’t joking
Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping
A fool come slipping, so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by the door
A real set of peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
Baby

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Outro]
This time around, babe!
He really thought[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Verse 2]
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Bridge]
Whisper three words and I'll come running
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Outro sung over the Chorus]
For you are not alone
Not alone oh
You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone
You are not alone
Not alone, Not alone
If you just reach out for me girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me not alone
Oh together together
Not not being alone
Not not being alone[Verse 1]
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feeling insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Verse 2]
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was dogging me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came and again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Outro]
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

[KGB interrogator - Russian to English Translation]
Why have you come from the West
Confess, to steal the great achievements of the people
The accomplishments of the worker[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, ah

[Verse 1]
Now I'm just wonderin', why you think
That you can get to me, with anything
Seems like you'd know by now, when and how I get down
And with all that I've been through, I'm still around

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby, I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you, baby

[Chorus]
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable

[Break]
Oh, dah, ah, well, ah, ah

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Now you can't stop me, even though you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing, ah
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughin', hah, while surfacing

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby, I've got what it takes (Yeah)
And there's no way you'll ever get to me (You can't do it, baby)
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me (Come on)
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby

[Chorus]
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable

[Bridge: Michael Jackson & The Notorious B.I.G]
You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here
Through all your lies and silly games
I'ma still remain the same, I'm (Uh) un- (Uh) breakable (What? Uh)

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in 10 G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly 9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any 'tel you in
Crack braggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'
Desert ease street sweeper inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messin' with the devil
What

[Chorus]
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (Yeah)
And you can't touch me (I'm untouchable), 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (You, you, you, you, you)
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (And I know)
And I know you hate it (You hate it), dah, and you can't take it (Hoo)
You'll never break me (I'm unbreakable), 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it (Hoo-hoo-hoo), you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it (Why did you do it?), and you can't take it (Just why did you do it? Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
You'll never break me
You can't touch me, you can't break me
You can't stand that [?] unbreakable, ooh!

And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo

Looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind
Helpless like a baby
Sensual disguise
I can't help but love you
It's getting better all the time

[Chorus]
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

[Verse 2]
Love to run my fingers
Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles to your eyes
Like a trip to heaven
Heaven is the prize
And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise
[Chorus]
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise

I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
Wouldn't help it, no no no[Verse 1]
When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feelin'
Then there ain't no room for you in this part of town
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

[Verse 2]
You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all gettin' loud
If you take the chance and do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

[Bridge]
Do what you want to do
There ain't no rules, it's up to you (Ain't no rules, it's all up to you)
It's time to come alive
And party on right through the night (All right)

[Verse 3]
Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Wanna see an exhibition (Ahee)
Better do it now before you get too old
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf (Yeah)
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all (Wanna live)
Tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf (Nine to five)
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all (Yeah)[Verse 1]
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away (Rock, right)

[Verse 2]
Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

[Pre-Chorus]
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away

[Bridge]
And when the groove is dead and gone (Yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever, on
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

[Chorus]
I wanna rock (All night)
With you girl (Sunlight)
Rock with you, rock with you girl (Yeah)

Rock you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Rock the night away

Feel the heat, feel the beat (All night)
Rock you into day (Sunlight)

Rock the night away[Chorus]
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

[Verse 1]
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

[Bridge]
So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

[Chorus]
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life[Verse 1: Michael and Janet]
I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting, so what does it mean, damn it?
You're kicking me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds, the whole system sucks, damn it!
Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong, then you better prove you're right!
You're selling out souls but I care about mine
I've got to get stronger, and I won't give up the fight!

[Pre-Chorus: Michael and Janet]
With such confusion don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme!
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize!

[Chorus: Both]
Somebody please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make you just want to scream!

[Verse 2: Michael and Janet]
I'm tired of you telling, the story your way
You're causing confusion, you think it's okay, damn it!
You keep changing the rules, while I'm playing the game
I can't take it much longer, I think I might go insane!
[Pre-Chorus: Michael and Janet]
With such confusion don't it make you want to scream?
Make you want to scream?
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme!
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie

[Chorus: Both]
Oh Father, please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me want to scream!

[Bridge: Janet]
Oh my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned the TV
This evening, I was disgusted by all the injustice, all the injustice! (All the injustice)
(A man has been brutally beaten to death by police
After being wrongly
Identified as a robbery suspect!
The man was an 18 year-old black male!)

[Pre-Chorus: Michael and Janet]
With such delusions don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme!
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize!
[Outro: Both]
Oh brother please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream![Verse 1]
I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side, ooh-ooh
Every moment takes me to paradise
Darling, let me hold you
I'll warm you in my arms and melt your fears away
Show you all the magic that a perfect love can make
I need you night and day

[Chorus]
So baby, be mine (baby, you got to be mine), ow
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (all the time), ooh-ooh
And we can share this ecstasy
As long as we believe in love

[Break]
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I won't give you reason to change your mind
(I can't sit still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
You are all the future that I desire
Girl, I need to hold you
Share my feelings in the heat of love's embrace
Show you all the passion burning in my heart today
It's never gonna fade

[Chorus]
So baby, be mine (baby you got to be mine), ow
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (all the time), ooh-ooh
You're everything this world could be
The reason that I live, oh

[Bridge]
Won't you stay with me until the morning sun
I promise you now that the dawn will be different
Lady can't you see that heaven's just begun
It's living here inside our hearts

[Verse 3]
There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
This will be a love lasting for all time
Girl, you got to hold me
We can touch the sky and light the darkest day
Hold me, only you and I can make sweet love this way
There's no more I can say-

[Chorus]
So baby, be mine (baby be mine, baby you got to be mine)
Ow! (tell me that you love me all the time)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give (say you're thinking of me)
So baby, be mine (girl be mine, all the time)
Ooh-ooh (show me how it should be, hold me tight)
You're everything this world could be (every night)
The reason that I live (it's alright, every night)

[Outro]
Baby, be my girl
(baby be mine, tell me that you love me all the time)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
(say you're thinking of me, girl be mine)
So baby, be mine, baby, be mine
(show me how it should be, hold me tight)
You're everything this world could be to me
(every night, it's alright)
C'mon, girl (baby be mine), c'mon girl (tell me that you love me)
Ow! (all the time) hoo! (say you're thinking of me)
So baby, be mine (girl be mine, show me how it should be)

C'mon, girl (baby be mine), c'mon girl (tell me that you love me)
Baby be mine (all the time), hoo! (say you're thinking of me)
So baby, be mine, girl[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts" (Hee-eeh)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, I was always on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (Ah-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)
Hee
Hoo
[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee)

[Break]
Ah, hee-hee-hee
Hee! Hoo!

[Chorus]
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Oh)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son (No-no-no)
She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one

[Outro]
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (Don't call me Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover...[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine, m-m-m
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine m-m-m

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

[Hook: Paul McCartney]
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Verse 3: Michael + Paul]
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
To one's town

[Bridge: Micheal Jackson]
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

[Verse 4: Michael + Paul]
Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Refrain: Michael + Paul]
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine (mine, mine); yep, she's mine (mine, mine)
The girl is mine (mine, mine); yeah, she's mine (mine, mine)

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

[Interlude: Michael + Paul]
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?
Ha, ha, Paul, I think I told you I'm a lover, not a fighter
Eh, I've heard it all before, Michael
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yeah, she said it; you keep dreaming

[Outro: Michael + (Paul)]
(I don't believe it!) (Mine, mine)
(No, no, no) The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
(No, mine) No, mine (Mine, mine)
(She's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine) (Mine, mine, mine)
'Cause the girl is mine
(No, the girl is mine) (Mine, mine)
The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
(No, the girl is mine)
The girl is mine (Mine, mine)
(No, she's mine)[Verse 1]
There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady, our love will shine (Lighting the night)
Just put your trust in my heart
And meet me in paradise (Now is the time)
Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away

[Chorus]
So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel alright
And, baby, through the years
Going to love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
That you will always be the lady in my life

[Verse 2]
Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl
[Chorus]
And I will keep you warm through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And, baby, through the years even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life

[Bridge]
Stay with me
I want you to stay with me
I need you by my side
Don't you go nowhere

(You are the lady in my life)[Chorus]
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something

[Chorus]
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)

It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2]
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always trying
To keep my baby crying
Treacherous, cunning, declining
You got my baby crying (Hee)

[Chorus]
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)

You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
They eat off of you (They eat off of you)
You're a vegetable
[Verse 3]
Billie Jean is always talking when nobody else is talking
Telling lies and rubbing shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, spying
Saying you just want to be starting something

[Chorus]

Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it (Woo!)
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man (Woo!)
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it, uh)

[Verse 2]
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (Woo!)
You have to show them that you're really not scared (Woo!)
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
(Woo!)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

[Verse 2]
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
[Bridge]
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why? Oh, why?
(That way) Why? Oh, why?

[Verse 3]
Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em!
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?), why (why?)

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)[Intro]

Where did you come from lady?
And ooh won't you take me there

Nothing can stop this burning desire to be with you
Got to get to you baby
Won't you come, it's emergency
Cool my fire yearning

We can dim the lights, just to make it right
In the night, hit the loving spot
I'll give you all that I've got

[Chorus]

Ha-ha-ha, I'll give you all that I got[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time
[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
(Ooh, ooh)
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side, ooh
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
(Ooh, ooh)
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Outro: Vincent Price &amp; Michael Jackson]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, ooh, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA![Chorus]
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I am the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta

[Verse 1]
What you're gonna do, cause I'm gonna get you
No where to run no where to hide
All the things you said, and the things you've done to me
You can no longer make me cry

Look what you done to me, baby
I can no longer smile, baby
And I've waited so long, just to carry on
I'm the blue gangsta

[Chorus x2]
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I am the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta

[Verse 2]
You tricked me nine to five, loving you is a crime
People telling me, you got another guy
I been abused, watch me light in fuse
Said you'd be my wife, nothing but big lies

Don't know what I've done, everything you got
Things you done to me, are coming back to you
You know just what I've done, the things you done to me
I'm the blue gangsta

[Chorus x2]
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I am the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta

[Verse 3]
See, I am so amused to the things you said
And the things you have done to me
There is nothing in this world to make me change
You make me want to sing
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

[Chorus x5]
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I am the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta[Verse 1]
I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I
So I asked her for her name

She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that
Was really into me

[Chorus 1]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can
(She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(She was wanting me)
She said just to give her a place
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I never would have thought she was living like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near
She would tell me how she feels

It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me

[Chorus 2]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can
(She was loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(She was loving me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife
(She was wanting me)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
(She was loving me)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
(She was wanting me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family
Yeah

Why.. Ooh no
Alright
Ohh
(I’m in love, love)

[Verse 3]
I didn’t know she was already spoken for
‘Cause I’m not that kind of man
Swear that I would’ve never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I’m holding her to blame

[Chorus 2]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can
(Holding her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(Holding her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife
(Holding her to blame)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
(Holding her to blame)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
(Holding her to blame)
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family
Yeah

[Chorus 2]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can

She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone

She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(She was loving me)
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife

She dances in the sheets at nights
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

[Chorus]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm

A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
[Verse 2]
She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

[Chorus]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

[Bridge]
She works so hard, just to make a way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
[Verse 3]
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

[Chorus]
Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
