"The honest answer to your question about Arabs who were expelled
from Jaffa, and/or who fled Jaffa, or anywhere else in Israel, having
the right to return is:  Yes, unfortunately, they have the right to
return.  They may apply for citizenship like any other non-Israeli and
then go to >Jaffa and try to buy their house back from the Jews who now
own it.  

	And now a question and answer for you:  Can the Jews who were
born and raised in Hebron, or their descendants go back to THEIR homes
in Hebron?  The answer is: absolutely NOT, because they were almost all
murdered by their Arab neighbors - the ""palestinians"".

	Now, do I think the Arabs should be allowed to even visit
""their"" homes in Jaffa?  Hell, no.  Bring back the Jews of Hebron, Petah
Tikva, Jerusalem, Safed, etc. Then, perhaps I would be in favor of Arabs
returning to their Jaffa homes.  However, seeing as no Arab has yet been
able to bring people back from the dead, I'd say that's out.

      _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
      no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have
      to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to
      ""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching
      by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
      least it was a good try...

   So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances?

I don't have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances ;-)

   Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star
   hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for
   implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of
   models.

Hmm, the ""superbowl"" burst has been claimed in press releases
to cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis, from what I've read
(and I haven't seen the papers, only the press) I'd say it is
consistent with some of the merging NS models

   A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came
   through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this

   Here is the abstract of that paper.

 ...
      indicator to these events all possible sources which are
      isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is
      why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,
      although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs
      from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs
      originate in the solar cometary cloud
      cannot be excluded until it is disproved.

This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no,
anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far
as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.
That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution
to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well
known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)
are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...

I too am a Jules Verne collector, and can tell you that though tough 
to find, it *is* out there.  I keep my eyes open all the time for his
books at various Bay Area used book stores, and every once in a while
get *very* lucky.  You just need diligence.  I don't know if the book
store situation near JSC is as good as the Bay Area, but good luck.
I have also had excellent luck at the Antiquarian Book Fair which comes
to SF every other year, though the prices are more in the $100-$200 range
than the $50 you want to spend.  My guess is that *if* you find it,
you won't need to spend even that much, since most people don't care 
about it.  I think I paid about $15 for my dust-jacket-less but otherwise
good condition copy, which I found one day at a small bookshop that happened
to have just bought a lot of random books at an estate sale.  

Of course, if you re willing to buy blind, you can put a $2 advertisement
in the Antiquarian Bookseller's newsletter (the exact title of which escapes
me at the moment.)  _Five Weeks in a Balloon_ is not the rarest of Jules
Verne books.  Someone has it for sale somewhere, and the AB is the way to 
find it.  In fact, I would be surprised if you didn't get multiple offers
of sale.  Of course, that takes the fun out of hunting for it yourself...

   Henry, if I read you correctly, you may be asking ""If I put a blackbody

from being blackbodies.  Many different observations, including IRAS

can range from 40K to 150K.  You might look in a conference proceedings

This was all badly reported in the news.  There is no evidence that
signs of life found in old rock predate putative planet-sterilizing
events.  Rather, the argument was that if life arose shortly the last
sterilizing event, then it must be easily formed.  The *inference*
was that life originated before and was destroyed, but there was
no evidence of that.

However, even this argument is flawed.  It could well be that origin of
life requires specific conditions (say, a certain composition of the
atmosphere) that do not last for long.  So, perhaps life formed
early only because it would have had no other chance to do so,
not because it was likely that life would originate under those
conditions.",3
"Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and
relaunching it:

(Caution: speculation mode engaged)
There is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet.
I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in
order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed
items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not
retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would
have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this
might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due
to thermal cycle stresses...)

I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the
HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are
much less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged
(I assume that they were caged for launch)?

   I think the answer to Mr. Mayamsky's question can be found in the
	 		 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(Mr. Mamaysky's)
   first amendment to the US Constitution.

	   Amendment I                                           (1791)

	   Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
	   religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or
	   abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the
	   right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition
	   the government for a redress of grievances.

   Steve

I do not say that freedom of speech should be banned. Far from it.
I am merely suggesting that there are certain things which can be
universally agreed to be morally incorrect. There are not many such
things. But there are some. As an example:

(1) murder is morally incorrect

(2) the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior to
another is morally incorrect

etc.

The point is that any action which serves to promote a morally
incorrect action should be forbidden. This implies that no one has the
right to say that an innocent person should be murdered. Regardless of
freedom of speech, I may not stand on a street corner and advocate the
murder of innocent people. The reason for this is that murder is a
morally incorrect action.

In the same way, since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrow
definition which we have given it, (2), I, nor any one else, has the
right to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry. Such an
enforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed by
the first amendment. It merely ensures that no person may be the
target of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right, such as
the right to not be murdered, and the right not to be discriminated
against.

I believe, Mr. Berson, that to blindly accept the constitution is a
terrific mistake. We must cinstantly question the constitution and
interpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live. Anything
short of such an effort would render us little more than trained
monkeys, who are able to merely repeat what they have heard without
paying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document in
question.

Well, as many a bored bike tourer can tell you, the way to steer
sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean.
Say you want to turn left.  You push your body off to the left.
To do this, you have to push against something, and the only
thing to push against is the ground (through the bike).  Well,
the apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the 
ground will push you right back.  So, you pushed yourself off to 
the left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground 
pushed back toward the left.  Well, that push is on both wheels.  
The rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing 
problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, which
had the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end), 
but the front wheel has trail.  If the ground pushes the front wheel 
toward the left at the contact patch, the trail will cause the 
wheel to turn to the right.  Hey, there we are.  No-hands counter-

Tell that to the people who run the 10-meter Keck telescope, or the 
astronomers and engineers working on the Gemini twin 8-meter telescope
project.  It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building
Keck II.  According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope, ""This
second 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope
with double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolve
the headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away.""   Japan's 8.3-meter
Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea.  All these telescopes
will work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes!

And haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics?  A lot of research
was done with ""Star Wars"" funding, and some is now being shared with
astronomers.  This shows great promise.  Soon, probably within a few
years, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their 
theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere.

To say that ""visible light astronomy is already a dying field"" is 
pure hokum.  To use the ""logic"" that things are already bad, so it doesn't
matter if it gets worse is absurd.  Maybe common sense and logic
are the dying fields.

    For someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an 
    absurd pseudo-organizational name like the 'Center for Policy

ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press,

    Herzl died eighty nine years ago.  Are you suggesting that he
    has stated what is Israel's policy today?  Have you ever seen
    Israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-Jews, let alone  
    actually try to remove non-Jews from Israel?  If you actually 
    believe that this quote has anything to do with Israel's non-
    Jewish citizenry today, you are an idiot.  But if you realize
    that Israel has no intention of removing non-Jewish Israelis,
    then you are nothing but a common liar.  This one time I will 
    give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you are stupid.

ED> (Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 1960, 
ED> I, p.88)

    Once again you quote a man gone for almost a century.  You do
    so within the context of modern day Israel.  
    
    Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.  How does this fact define the
    United States today?


ED> ""[Jews] must expel Arabs and take their place"" 
ED> (David Ben Gurion, 1937, quoted in Shabtai Teveth, Ben 
ED> Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press, 
ED> 1985, p. 89)

    Did he say 'Jews,' or did you add this?
 
    This was also a statement from ten years before Israel became
    a state.  It has no bearing on Israel.  
    

ED> ""We must do everything to ensure they [the 
ED> Palestinian refugees] never do return""
ED> (David Ben Gurion, in his diary, 19 July 1948, quoted in 
ED> Michael Bar Zohar, Ben Gurion: The Armed Prophet, 
ED> Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.157)

    YOU added the words 'the Palestinian refugees.'  And by doing
    so, you are misleading people into believing that Ben Gurion,
    who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands,
    at the encouragement of people such as KING ABDULLAH, and the  
    MUFTI OF JERUSALEM, was gloating over people abandoning their
    homes.  What he was refering to were the Arabs with whom Jews
    were at war.  

ED> ""The country was mostly an empty desert, with only 
ED> a few islands of Arab settlement""
ED> (Shimon Peres, Minister of Defense, quoted in David's 
ED> Sling: The Arming of Israel, Weidenfeld and Nicholson, 
ED> 1970, p.249)

    At the time of the rebirth of Israel this was certainly true,
    especially when compared to what Israel has accomplished in a
    few short decades.


ED> ""All this story about the danger of extermination [of 
ED> Jews] has been blown up....to justify the annexation of 
ED> new Arab territories""
ED> (Mordechai Bentov, Israeli Cabinet Minister, Al 
ED> Hamishmar, 14 April 1972)

    Since Israel has not annexed even one millimeter of territory 
    in more twenty six years, this quote is irrelevant. 


ED> ""Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can 
ED> disqualify terrorism as a means of combat""
ED> (Yitzhak Shamir, Hehazit, Summer 1943 [Journal of the 
ED> LEHI, the Stern Gang], translated from the Israeli daily 
ED> Al-Hamishmar, 24 December 1987

    Again, you are quoting a man who was fighting for what he had
    been promised from a time as ancient as biblical, to the time
    of the Balfour Declaration, just a few short years back.  And
    what was thought of and described as terrorism by Jews didn't
    include slaughtering Olympic athletes, brutally murdering the 
    innocent, attacking school buses, and murdering another human 
    being for the sole reason that he or she is an Arab.
 
 
ED> ""The domination of Jewish agriculture by Arab 
ED> workers is a cancer in our body""
ED> (A. Uzan, Israeli Minister of Agriculture, Ha'aretz, 13 
ED> December 1974)

    There were serious concerns about a work force that consisted 
    of people from OUTSIDE Israel.  It is a wise to be concerned.
    A work force consisting of foreigners is not a good situation
    for a country.


ED> ""There can be only one national home in Palestine, 
ED> and that a Jewish one, and no equality in the partnership 
ED> between Jews and Arabs""
ED> (Montague David Eder, President of the Zionist 
ED> Federation of Great Britain, 1931,
ED> in Doreen Ingrams, comp., Palestine Papers 1917-1922, 
ED> Seeds of Conflict, George Braziller, 1973, p. 135)

    This also has no meaning for a country formed seventeen years
    after this statement was made.  Obviously times change.  This
    is NOT what Israel is about today.  I believe the peace talks
    make this quote irrelevant.


ED> ""There is not a single Jewish village in this country 
ED> that has not been built on the site of an Arab village""
ED> (Moshe Dayan, Ha'aretz, 4 April 1969...)

    This is completely false.


ED> ""Some people talk of expelling 700,000 to 800,000 
ED> Arabs in the event of a new war, and instruments have

ED> (Aharon Yariv, former chief of Israeli military 
ED> intelligence, 1980, Inquiry, 8 December 1980)

    Expelled from where?  Israel?  The occupied territories?  New
    Jersey?  Is there any way we can read this and get an idea as
    to what on earth he was talking about.  Obviously not.

 
ED> ""We should there [in Palestine] form a portion of the 
ED> rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization 
ED> as opposed to barbarism.""
ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Jewish State, London, 1896, p. 
ED> 29)

    Interesting notion.  Considering that this was written nearly
    a century ago, it is quite visionary.


ED> ""I deeply believe in launching preventive war 
ED> against the Arab States without further hesitation. By 
ED> doing so we will achieve two targets: firstly, the 
ED> annihilation of Arab power; and secondly, the expansion

ED> (Menachem Begin, in a speech to the Knesset, 12 October 
ED> 1955)

    This was said nearly forty years ago.  Begin is dead.  And it
    should be obvious to anybody that if Israel was expansionist,
    it would have ANNEXED the occupied territories right after it
    captured them.  Israel would not be negotiating to get rid of
    them.


ED> ""During the last 100 years our people have been in a

ED> (Moshe Dayan, Ma'ariv, 7 July 1968)

    He's dead, too.  And since Israel has not annexed ANY land at 
    all since 1967, you are once again wasting bandwidth with all
    of these misleading quotes.  They are so out of sync with the
    reality of Israel, that you do nothing but make yourself look
    like a fanatic desperate to sway people, by misleading them.

Actually, just after the FIRST world war, many Muslims were killed by Serbs.
Under Serbian-led regime between the two world wars, many Croats were
also killed (especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan. 6, 1929).
Some Croats formed a resistance movement ""Ustashas"" (Insurgents) and
were forced into exile, to fascist Italy, which sheltered them.  In exile,
they practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia; while Croats in
Croatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership
of Vladko Macek.  After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world
war, Vladko Macek refused to collaborate, so Ustashas were brought in 
to run the newly formed puppet state.  This state included both Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats
(""flowers of Croatian people"").  Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina
therefore joined Ustashas.  However, even more others did not; they
joined Tito's Partisans.    The Ustashas membership peaked at 
less than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time.

After WWII, Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended
from Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago.  But, in 1968,
it was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality as
either Serbs or Croats is not a good policy.  Dobrica Cosic, the current
president of the rump Yugoslavia, was strongly opposed, and sought to
prevent the category ""Muslim"" (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on the
next census.  He was criticized and expelled from the party.  So, since
that time, Bosnian Muslims are considered a separate nationality, although
some still deny this and insist that they choose either Serb or Croat
nationality.",4

Alberto, you've repeatedly misunderstood my postings.  You are now making the exact point
that I've made several times but with a different definition of religion.  You don't not
have to believe in the ""religious"" aspects of Judaism to be a Jew (this would confine
Judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity.).  So, by converting out of
Judaism, I don't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism.  I mean voluntarily
removing yourself from the Jewish nation.  I am an agnostic but still consider myself
Jewish because of my cultural heritage.  (I admit that many religious jews would argue
that I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but Judaism is a religion of
dissent and debate isn't it?).  The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by
converting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most
open nation.  We have no quotas!

So I will once again make my point.  Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion
(not, as you say, religious belief) is NOT racism.  You come to your incorrect conclusion
because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and
when you define judaism.",4

8 MB SIMMs do not have to be composite SIMMs, although many (most?) 16 MB

Good point, did not catch this in the original post. The only other things 
which come to mind, since this is a gravity feed fuel system, is this.
The fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. Let
suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the
vacuum valve in the fuel petcock. When it is cold, the hole is open enough
to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on, 
since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas, 
and as the engine and surrounding area warm up, the hole seals up. 

One way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side 
panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. Connect a tube of the 
correct size, preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow, on the output
side of the fuel petcock. Remove the control hose from #1 carburator. Make
sure the tank is full. Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum 
to the control hose, preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge, to check 
for air leaks. With vacuum applied, fuel should flow freely. To see if there is
a vent problem, do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed, if it 
flows a lot faster with the filler cap open, then there may be something in 
the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog 
or partially clog the vent. I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced 
to fix this problem. So the things which might be defective are, the control
hose from #1 carb, the petcock valve, and possibly the fuel tank vent.

Now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold, then there 
is something in the carbs screwed up, but there are so many things to check, 
I would be typing all day to list them all! 

Here are a few, with everything back together, apply vacuum to the petcock valve
and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. Open up the
airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs, there are
quite a few on each carb.

I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. If American
Honda does not resolve this, get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and

This proposal would work only if your various targets are relaively nearby and

might be one possibility for such a mission -- I recall a paper being presented
at an AIAA deisgn conference in Irvine in February where such a proposed
spacecraft was designed by some grad students at UT Austin (I think).  Four
mini-spacecraft would detatch from the main S/C, each visiting a seperate
asteroid and then returning to the main S/C.  After analysis, the main S/C
would then be targeted for the most ""interesting"" object for further study.

    The above claim that you do not hate anybody may not be quite
    true.  The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the
    intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in
    this group.  Your complete lack of objectivity toward Israel, 
    and Jewish identity in general, reveal biases that indicate a
    great steaming heap of hatred!
    
    You certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for
    objectivity. You repeatedly post items or quotes removed from 
    their original context so that they can be used to further an 
    agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of Israel.

    You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image 
    of several Israeli leaders.  I can't say if you actually HATE
    these leaders, but the lies and misrepresentations of them do
    suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them.
    
    So, while you claim that you do not hate anybody, there is an
    ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is 
    false.  It is obvious that you hate Israel, and it is evident
    that you hate the Jewish people.

    And, if you are Jewish, you are a self-hating Jew.  There can
    be no doubt of this.  Although you will call upon your Jewish
    background in an effort to claim the high moral ground, there
    is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade
    away completely, as a people.  Your advocacy of intermarriage
    for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that 
    you hate the Jewish people.

    And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your
    own Jewishness on all Jews, you've clearly demonstrated to me 
    that you hate yourself.

""On the nights 11-12 March, 1918 alone Armenian butchers 
 bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding
 Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits, most
 likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish 
 Muslims, in groups of 80. My adjutant counted and unearthed
 200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization.""

        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)

""The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the
 liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the
 allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of
 the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian
 was permitted to approach the city and its environs.

 While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained
 in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the
 area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to 
 attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the
 plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder
 of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by
 the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers
 who had remained in the rear during the war.

 One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of
 soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of
 seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,
 and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud
 and dirt...

 It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and
 traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds
 and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night
 patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The 
 Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear
 also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the
 trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for
 fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder
 and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.

 Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir
 Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander
 in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.
 The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals
 that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its
 highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half
 of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.

 ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,
 Odishelidge. They were as follows:

 The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the
 act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...
 More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been
 killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless 
 Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the
 murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood 
 near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:
 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten
 more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when
 the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.

 The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently
 fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.
 Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw
 towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew
 to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and
 destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.

 During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages
 that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the 
 Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers
 were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time
 when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill
 the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries
 of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the 
 Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would
 have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from
 acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with
 hatred and loathing.

 Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that
 he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The
 Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the
 stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since
 the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed
 in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen
 of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping
 him with the iron heel of his boot.

 Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape
 from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off
 by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered
 children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village
 of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:

 There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.
 Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and
 spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about
 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 
 centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,
 children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of
 rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.

 A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators
 for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov
 to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be 
 proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's
 disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,
 instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely
 reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told
 the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more
 licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent
 and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity
 and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,
 the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and
 claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.

 An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command
 narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:

 The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut
 out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.
 The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men 
 of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they
 took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people
 among this group were able to save their lives as the result of
 my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were 
 released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. 
 Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the
 Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered
 on the streets.

 On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent
 Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were
 threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for
 murdering an innocent Turk. 

 When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would 
 be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare
 you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the 
 Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard
 that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within
 the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same 
 day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to
 him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible
 act. However no result was achieved.

 In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a
 natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived
 the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the 
 Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had
 been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. 
 The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed
 one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached
 three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details
 of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers
 were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even
 withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred
 people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading
 Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.
 However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with
 the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower
 classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders
 of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. 

 I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals
 were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who
 opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that
 it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.
 Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian
 cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have
 supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred
 to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by
 the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.
 You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a
 conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear
 of the Turkish soldiers.

 The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real
 nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can
 be undone.""

Could an atheist accept a usage in which religious literature or

Well, here goes.

The first item of business is to establish the importance space life
sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind.  I mean compared
to football and baseball, the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested
or even curious about spaceflight.  I think that this forum can
make a major change in that lack of insight and education.

All of us, in our own way, can contribute to a comprehensive document
which can be released to the general public around the world.  The
document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long
term human habitation in space.

I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to 
succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld
(i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering,
chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created
to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.

So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective
methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies
which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailed
literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates
and clearly important to existing space programs.

In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into
various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies.

Indeed, the sky doesn't look much like a black body if you look carefully
enough; in particular, its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a
bit higher than you would see from a black body.  Morgan&Gordon's fat
""Communications Satellite Handbook"" has a graph of sky temperature vs.
wavelength, in fact, for communications design.

However, in terms of energy content, the RF frequencies are negligible.
For thermal purposes, at very large distances from the Sun the sky
looks like a black body at 3.5K (Allen, ""Astrophysical Quantities"").
I haven't found a number for non-large distances, since solar radiation
tends to be something you can't just ignore :-), but M&G says ""about 4K""
in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem.",3

The way I see it (and please, astromomers give me a swift net-kick in

makes another in the near future a non-thought.  Perhaps those self

                         The Dream Machines:
An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature

                            By Ron Miller
                  with Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke

Krieger Publishing Company

Orig. Ed. 1993
Pre-publication $84.50
ISBN 0-89464-039-9


This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a
technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the
space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the
tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make
such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized
that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to
reach them.   

Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,
attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of
technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel
became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed
than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that
matter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason
as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate
reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and
knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as
well as selected events important in developing the idea of
extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological
entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and
speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between
simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal
connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every
entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every
spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This
allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize
differences, similarities, and influences.

This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,
and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic
diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and
historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The
unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and
very interesting history of the spaceship.

SPECIAL FEATURES

Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and
fictional

Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos
contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare
illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and
drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and
obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA
archives

An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

In the abstract, what you're saying is true.  But the facts happen to
agree with me, and disagree completely with you.  


Listen, Pinkas.  I'm going to count on the supposition that you think
through the opinions you have - something which is, by the way, against
my better judgment based on what I've seen from you to date.  We are
agreed, aren't we, that dictionaries are *reference books* for the usage
of a given language, and in particular for the meanings of the words and
phrases which comprise that language?  Now, you are using meanings
completely different from, indeed in some cases diametrically different
from, those given in the dictionary.  As a reference book, a dictionary
contains those meanings in both past and (as much as it can) in current
use.  That's also why they are updated so often.  Now, if you are saying
things which you give different meanings than the dictionary does, and
using non-standard meanings about every word, what is your chance of
being taken at face value...?

Just about none.  Just about no one will take you that way because the
words mean something different to them.  It's quite clear to me from
the response this thread has been getting that that is exactly what is
happening.  Ponder that.



What you did was ask a leading question.  In English idiom, the phrase
""and guess why..."" in the way you used it is a loaded question, with
only one answer expected.  

I also take offense at being told I cannot read by someone who is
obviously having trouble with the subject himself.  Mr. Pinkas, I am a
PhD candidate in my field.  One does not get to PhD candidacy if one
cannot read.  


Balderdash.  You know this is false.  I would be able to make the
abstraction if it bore any resemblance to the facts of the matter.
Yours did not.  The analogy is utterly inapplicable.

I wouldn't be in the field I'm in -- astrophysics -- if I couldn't make
abstractions and speculate about the general grand scheme of things.  I
also wouldn't be in education -- which I am (and my students give me
rather good reviews I'd add) -- if I couldn't draw such analogies.


The vast majority of Palestinians in Israeli prisons aren't tortured,
and their houses weren't blown up by the army.  In fact, you've seen me
protesting such measures ON THIS NET before.  Are you now trying to
intimate my agreement with them?


Do you know the meanings of the words you use or do you expect the
reader to read your mind?  I can read just fine thank you.  And I don't
need someone who is obviously having some troubles with a tongue which
isn't his native one telling me how to read the words in my own native
tongue.  If it were Spanish, I'd ask you.  


Yes, they are.  As you well know.


Balderdash.  See above.  Once again, you have a lot of gall and
absolutely no right to lecture a native speaker of a language, who is
well educated in it, in a language which isn't your own native tongue
and with which you're obviously having problems.


Social life is one thing, legal status is another.  Once again, this is
a leading question.


Final question:  Is it possible to be both Jewish and Muslim?  Jewish
and Christian?  Your response will be enlightening.

Your ignorance is hardly characteristic of most '*ians'. Sarkis Atamian 
explains in his book called 'The Armenian Community, New York 1955, 
Philosophical Library' that, according to historians, original fatherland 
of the Armenians was in Thessaly, Greece. Armenian invaders burned and 
sacked the fatherland of Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population 
and presented to the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian 
civilization. All reliable western historians describe how Armenians 
ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly 
people of Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of 
the Muslim people between 1914-1920. It is unfortunately a truth that 
Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II 
and that, even today, criminal members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism 
Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism 
among peoples. 


Who says 'Arromdians' are no damn good? During World War II Armenians 
were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over 
the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, 
carried statements as follows:[1]

""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)
 when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it 
 becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon
 method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical
 operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing."" 

Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -
extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San
Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published
in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.

 ""We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities
  against our people (Jews). Members of our family witnessed the 
  murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian 
  neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish 
  and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see 
  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors.
  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise 
  to grant themselves government if, in return, the Armenians would 
  help exterminate Jews. Armenians were also hearty proponents of
  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.""

  Signed Elihu Ben Levi, Vacaville, California.

I have to agree with Ward.  The problem with your approach is they add
up what you can reasonably claim as 'spin-offs', add up what's been
spent on space, and then come back with something like, ""You spent $X
billion for that?  Wouldn't it be better just to spend the money on
direct research and forget all this space stuff?  We could have got
all that stuff a *lot* cheaper that way.  Space is wasteful and
inefficient.""

Then they cancel your funding and spend it studying mating rituals of
New Guinea tribesmen or something.

Well, there are several bursts in species diversity I can think of.
The Cambrian and Ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase
in animal diversity. Likewise, after the one-two punch of the
Permian and Triassic extinctions, the number of marine animals
rose steadily (**) to an all-time high (*) just prior to the spread 
of humans.

(**) biggest exception being the K/T (bye bye dinos) extinction

(*) about 800 families

Also, plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in
succesive sweeps. Mosses colonized very wet environments first,
ferns (who had evolved vascular tissues) took over more territory
when they evolved (1). These were eventually (mostly) replaced by gymnosperms
(pines and the like) (2) and then (mostly) displaced by angiosperms (flowering
plants -- now the dominant plant group on the planet(3). Fungi
also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land. 

(1) around the carboniferous (up to about 200 families)
(2) around the triassic (up to maybe 250 families)
(3) starting in the cretaceous (rising to about 600 families currently)

It's unclear (to me at least) what the max equilibrium number
of species the earth can hold (***) and if it has ever hit this
in the past. It could be (warning: speculation alert) that
diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions
happen often enough to keep the total number down.

(***) This would depend a great deal on how fragmented
specific ecosystems were. 

See Cowen's book ""History of Life"" for a not-too-technical
run-down on, well, like the title sez, the history of life.
Or see, Wilson's ""Diversity of Life"" for a view centered more
on current ecology -- this is (IMHO) the best popular biology
book of (what the hell, I'll say it) all time.

However, the way you have posted seems to be typical of those who have

close look at what you've posted thought a bit about the combatative

Is (was? :-( ) your HG zipper the nylon-coil type or the kind with
molded plastic teeth? I've only tried it on the coiled nylon type, and
it doesn't take much squish to fix the problem. I found I was overdoing
it (no broken parts, but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after
spreading the zipper pull jaws again, I tried with Vice-Grips. No, not
the usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so
they were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the
adjusting screw a bit. A couple of iterations and I had just the right
amount of Zipper Squish (TM).


I've had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit (actually on the
Accessory Ellipse), and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of
charge. I don't know what brand of zippers HG uses, but parts ARE
available for YKK's plastic zippers. Replacement was pretty simple, just
break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps
the pull from coming off the top end. Slide on the new zipper pull. Then
crimp on (Vice-Grips again!) a replacement zipper stop.

You might try fabric stores & such and see if they sell replacement
parts.

Ethiopian Jews and not-quite Jews

The Israeli press has published items about Ethiopian 
Jews waiting in camps in Addis Ababa for immigration to 
Israel, who are dying of starvation. The following are 
excerpts from an interview with the former general 
director of the JDC project for development and welfare 
of Ethiopian Jews, Kobi Friedman (Hadashot, 21 April 
1993), who has stated that ""there are people dying in 
Addis Ababa, but they are converts to Christianity"":

""Hadashor published the item about the dying Jews after 
viewing a video tape filmed last week in Adis Ababa. 
How do you know that they are actually converts to 
Chritianity ?

""If there are Jews on the tape, then I don't know what to 
say. I am speaking from experience when I say that those 
who remained in Ethiopia are Christians. I know that 
there have previously been things published in the press 
by interesting parties, and there is no connection 
between them and reality.""

""What interested parties ?""

""Ethiopian immigrants who want their Christian relatives 
to come here.""

""What to you recommend that Ethiopian children in Israel 
do, when their parents and the rest of their relatives 
remain in Ethiopia ?""

""I ask if it is the job of the State of Israel to bring in the 
40 relatives who stayed in Ethiopia. Well, my answer is 
that it is not. It would be a better solution, economically 
as well, for that young man to buy a one-way ticket to 
Ethiopia and reunite with his family there.""",4

Actually, the record of the Allies activities, in the face of
incontrovertible evidence as to what the Nazis (may they rot in hell)
were doing, clearly points to the conclusion that they would have done
nothing.  The railways to the camps were not bombed, despite the ease
of doing so.  The US, the ""place of refuge"" allowed in a bare pittance
of Jews from Europe, primarily for public relations, so that the
government could say it was ""doing something"".  Many ships with
refugees were turned away from US shores; some found refuge in Cuba or
South America, many others sunk or had to return to Europe (with
predictable consequences).  The hope today is that we have
collectively learned a lesson, and are less complacent to ignore other
countries' ""internal affairs"".  The sad reality is that this does not
seem to be the case.

From _Free Inquiry_, Winter 83/84,  the following is an
introduction to the article ""Joseph Smith and the Book of
Mormon"", by George D. Smith.  The introduction is written by
Paul Kurtz. 

	Mormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
	-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of
	the world's fastest growing religions, with as many as
	200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church's
	aggressive missionary program, covering more than one
	hundred countries, it is spreading even to third world
	countries.
	
	Mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and
	evangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict
	authoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly
	receives revelations directly form God, and a group of
	twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief
	and practice, the church is opposed to abortion,
	pornography, sexual freedom, women's rights, and other, in
	its view, immoral influences of secular society, and it
	forbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea.
	
	Centered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy
	and politically powerful in Utal and many other western
	states.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft
	Benson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family,
	the Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed
	government officials.
	
	The Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by
	Joseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had
	found gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill
	and that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he
	had been able to translate the writing into the _Book of
	Mormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written ""by
	the commandment of God,"" claims that the ancient Hebrews
	settled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors
	of the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who
	have been baptized in the ""true church"" will be reunited
	after death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can
	be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the
	hereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been
	considered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and
	as heretics by religious fundamentalists.
	
	Joseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was
	both worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because
	of persecution he led his band of loyal followers from
	Palmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois,
	where in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham
	Young, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over
	the leadership of the church and led the Mormons further
	westward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. 
	Following the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of
	polygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice
	in nineteenth-century America.
	
	While other religions go back many centuries --
	Muhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism,
	3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are
	difficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon
	roots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this
	history objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny
	is dangerous to the faith.
	
	In the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles
	about the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong
	member of the church, provides a detailed critical
	examination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of
	Mormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion
	of an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a
	Mormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the
	history of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz
	

The article itself is super.",0
" 

My fiancee' and I do quite a bit of sporty riding 2-up.  I'll tell you 
what we've found and the systems we've worked out.

- On starts, accelerate MUCH slower than usual.  It's tough for the rider
to judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we're holding onto something
and leaning forward.  Remember this.

- On turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally 
this means she isn't leaning at all.)  It's very disconcerting to be leaned
over and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up.
Much balance is lost and this can be dangerous.

- On slowing and stopping, do so MUCH slower than usual.  Again, it's tough 
for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we're holding 
onto something and leaning forward.  However, you'll figure it out fast
because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which 
shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.

- Generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not 
out wide.  This helps balance and gives her somegrip.

- When you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you.
Normally this means ""slow down, and do it now!"".  



We only have a couple signals.  ""Slow down"" is her either tapping me on 
the back, or slapping my helmet with all her might.  Depends on the urgency
of the matter :-)

""Turn here"" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit.  This is
also the sign for ""cool!  Look at that.""  ""I hafta pee"" is the same sign
as ""turn here"".  ""I'm hungry"" is the same sign.  ""Go faster"" is usually
done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee.  I usually see ""slow
down"" more often than ""go faster"".
 

The best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and 
pillion on his or her bike.  It's incredibly frustrating, because you're 
in almost no control.  Now, multiply that feeling times ten, because
you as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely
feel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes
at any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc.  
Pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.

Also, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up
than by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and
""in the Zen of the moment"" less.  Remember this.

Israeli nationalism (also known as Zionism) is the nationalism of the
Jewish people.  The Jewish people are not a new phenomenon at all.

Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arab people.  Arabs have
been around for a long time.  They already  have some 2 dozen states,
large and small, covering 98% of the Middle East.

More specifically, Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arabs
from the region of Palestine, just as Egyptian nationalism is the
nationalism of Arabs from the region of Egypt.  One Palestinean state
already exists in what was once known as Palestine: - it is called
Jordan. 

There is no justification in carving out a second and tiny Palestinean
state out of the only Jewish state, itself very, very small, just as
there is no justification in carving out another American state out of
Mexico.

"Orating with wild abandon, prange@nickel.ucs.indiana.edu (Henry Prange) offers:
%The grips on my GS are a wonderful thing in the winter and no problem
%in the summer. Vibration? BMW's don't vibrate. Everyone knows that.

I'd agree with Henry.  The grips are really nice to have in winter,
and aren't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer.  

My only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'.
This has been complained about by every reviewer, official and
unofficial, that's ever talked about these grips.  The 'high' setting
is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things
just get a bit nippy, but since 'low' doesn't produce a noticable
effect, I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature
about right.  This generally isn't a problem when wearing thicker
winter gloves.  When I asked the dealer if they could fix it, I
received a consoling pat on the back, and their sincere apologies for
the poor design (actually, I was told they worked just like they were
suppose to).

Then you haven't been paying attention to the arguments levelled against
them. They have been, over and over again.  They will be again.


Hey, what do you think dictionaries are for?  You quite obviously need
one.  A good dictionary gives both, and you well know it.


I don't think that data exist on this directly.


That is no problem.  But once again you are defining Zionism as *ONE*
movement.  You are implying that it is monolithic.  You *KNOW* this is
not and has never been the case.


You don't say it directly.  You implied it, and I showed explicitly
where and how you implied it.  Now you're trying to wriggle out of it.
Won't wash, and you know it.


It's you, not me, who is running out of arguments.  


What you said is that ""Judaism is defined according to religious
standards.""  Now this can have several different meanings, and you know
it.  One of the meanings that it can have is to say that ""Only those who
are religious are defined as Jews"".  Another is to say that ""Only those
who meet the religious definition of a Jew is one.""  And there are
others.  I'm not twisting your words.  I'm trying to make you aware that
your words don't mean what you think they do.


Actually, it doesn't.  And the citizens' rights are exactly THE SAME in
both cases, anyway.


Jewish


Jewish


It'll depend on what religion is practiced in the house.  The original
law of return would still admit such a person if they were Jewish, if
memory serves.


Not Jewish.



That's valid, as far as I can see.


More than once.  As have others.


The very one you give above.  It is absolutely inconsistent with the
twist you put on it.  


No you didn't.  You had to twist the definition of the word 180 degrees
in order to do so, and everyone else knows it.  I'm not being touchy.


Because what you gave *WAS NOT* an example.  IT WAS an example of how
the definition of a word can be twisted around 180 degrees.  


Oh, so now what are dictionaries for?


Duh.  As a scientist, whose technical terms are very often not found in
common dictionaries, I know this.  But when a term is common, like
hypocrisy, a good dictionary can be regarded as an authoritative source.


It's not nonsense.  When people read what you write, they have to try to
associate a meaning to those words.  Dictionaries give the meanings of
words, don't they?  Now, I assume that you'd like to have the words you
use mean what you'd like them to.  But the fact is, you're using very
different meanings than are in the dictionary, or you would like the
reader to assign them new meanings, which they never had.  


Not at all.  What I cannot abide is utter bombast when you've been
proven completely wrong.


I never put even one syllable in your mouth.  You have tried to prove
this and you failed.  


Poppycock.


I read what you said.  I did not add anything.  You simply either don't
know that the words don't mean what you'd like them to - which cannot be
the case now since you've been proven wrong and you quite obviously
don't have a defense against the arguments presented, or you're twisting
the meanings.  Which is it?

Spring break, I went through the four corners area and back.  The most
beautiful stop I made was in Utah at the Needles Overlook.  Though this
is a bit further east than where you appear to be going, I highly
recommend it.  IMHO it is far more beautiful than the Grand Canyon.  It
was not well marked, but was one of few paved roads off of US191 (I was
heading north from Monticello).  In order to get to the right place, I
should clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK, and not the recreation
area.  Heading north from Monticello, it is the second turnoff, and may
have been marked as the Anticline Overlook.  Anticline overlook is
about 20 (dirt, if this matters to you) miles past the Needles
overlook.  The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably
maintained (I ran it about 70mph).

Looking out from the overlook was like being God and looking down on 
the world.  If it isn't too far out of your way, you should see it.

Date: 12 May 1993 17:19:43 -0400

No, I'm not claiming 2,000,000 have been killed.  We are in the middle of
the genocide process that Mr. Major has given yet another ""green light""
to.  Mladic seems to have most of what he wants, but Boban is just
getting his appetite whetted. Because Mladic refuses to allow
international observers to inspect mass-grave sites and killing centers
in places like Foca, Brcko, and Visegrad, it will be years before we have
an accurate account of the number killed. 

In practical terms, it would be impossible to kill all 2,000,000.  There
just isn't the kind of machinery of crematoria and gas chambers and
transportation lines that the Nazis took 8 YEARS to develop.  And
remember, the Nazis killed minorities in the countries they occupied.  To
actually kill 42% of the population requires extreme genocidal
organization.   

But I do claim that the goal of the genocide is the systematic
annihilation of Bosnian Muslim culture, by killing as many as is
feasible, by rape, by torture, by the demolition of mosques, libraries,
and culture artificts, the burning and renaming of villages, the shelling
of civilians.  So that there won't be any of the 2,000,000 or so Muslims
whose lives have not been shattered by the genocide, though they still
may be alive.

And Mr. Major not only finds this acceptable, he helps it along by making
sure that the victims don't have arms to defend themselves.

   Hi,

   I have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this
   LCIII PDS Ethernet adapter with an optional 68882 socket on the board.
   My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 68882
   on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? Intuitively,
   the math co-processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but
   I am not sure how good Apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when
   it comes to throughout. Does anyone know the answer to this or have
   any experience with the Asante LCIII Ethernet adapter? Thanks in advance.

From what I've heard the PDS slot clock is only 16MHz, to be
compatible with the old LC style boards, while the FPU socket close to
the CPU is clocked at 25MHz.

I guess a board designed for the LCIII can get a 25MHz clock from the
extended PDS socket...",1

I would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which
ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus.  In the real world
(tm) it's easier for theists (well, people in general really) to lock
themselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those
people who are of the same opinion as they are.  In college you are
constantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have
different ideas about life, the universe, and everything.  It is much much
harder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else's ideas from
reaching you.

So, in a world where theists are forced to contend with and listen to
atheists and theists of other religions some are bound to have a change in
their beliefs over four years.  There is nowhere to run.... :-)

"   Analog SF magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few
years ago.  The question was, if an alien spacecraft landed in
Washington, D.C., what was the proper organization to deal with it: The
State Department (alien ambassadors), the Defense Department (alien
invaders), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (illegal aliens),
the Department of the Interior (new non-human species), etc.  It was
very much a question of our perception of the aliens, not of anything
intrinsic in their nature.  The bibliography for the article cited a
philosophical paper (the name and author of which I sadly forget; I
believe the author was Italian) on what constitutes a legal and/or moral
person, i.e., a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a
person.  The paper was quite interesting, as I recall.

human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures (does
underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges?) is terrible.  The

     Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can 
engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order 
harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a 
satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of 
months to years. 

     My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT 
satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In 
particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in 
altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude 
of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18 
March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the 
limitations of NORAD's software -- but that's another story.) 

    This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71 
degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is 
unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But 
it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the 
situation. 

    (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, 
the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic 
genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of 
annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 
2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year 
homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

That is the result of watching anti-Muslim 'SDPA' Nazis/crooks/idiots 
too much. Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents 
and Nazi Armenian parents? Not a chance. As early as 1934, K. S. Papazian 
asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians

        'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]

At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would
actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World
War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslim
population of Eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological
tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before
the outbreak of the Second World War.

In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted
in the 'Hairenik Weekly:' 

""The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall 
 see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations
 and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to
 the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are
 strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.
 On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is
 bereft of social sanctities.""[2]

   1934), Preface.

   Refuge' by O. Zarmooni.

In April 1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus.
A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German
officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian
Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.
Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his
Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the
creation of an Armenian SS formation in order 

""to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the 
 spirit of the Nazi ideas.""

He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories
of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish
homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels
Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language
radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were
produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]

The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored
by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the
establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any 
official position. His views were represented by his men in the
respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro
and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.
Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after
a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to
Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] 

A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not
'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.
As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians
were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August 
1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of
Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.

Yes, atheists tend to claim self control and self ownership. Are you saying
that theists claim to not have self control? I don't think atheists are
""dominantly arrogant."" They don't claim some god that has supremacy over
all of mankind. Now this claim would be arrogant, but atheists don't claim 
it. Most atheists do claim to own themselves. I think any disagreement with
this claim of self ownership would be supremely arrogant.

the Highway Patrol took a few of the opposition Senators out and gave
them some shots, and when they hit .07, put them on a course dodging

Indeed so; it's at the extreme limit of what is humanly possible.  It is
possible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude:  there
is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere -- beyond what is induced
by the Earth's rotation -- thanks to the overall circulation pattern of
the atmosphere (air cools at poles and descends, flowing back to equator
where it is warmed and rises), and this helps just enough to make Everest-
without-oxygen feasible.  Only just feasible, mind you:  the guys who did
it reported hallucinations and other indications of oxygen starvation,
and probably incurred some permanent brain damage.",3

Bill, you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its
sole purpose the validation of atheism.  It doesn't.  This board is
used to discuss atheism as a philosophy, to share posters' experiences
regarding atheism, to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole, to
share resources relating to atheism, and even to socialize with others
with similar views.  And of course with the number of theists who come
here to preach, it is also used to argue the case for atheism. 



If you want to accuse people of lying, please do so directly.  The
phrase ""deliberately mistaken"" is rather oxymoronic.

 

The two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are
Christianity and Islam.  Both of these claim to make their followers
into good people, and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been
accomplished through their faiths.  IMHO they are right.  The American
Friends Service Committee (Quaker), Catholic Relief Services, Bread
For The World, Salvation Army soup kitchens, and Mother Theresa spring
to mind.  (Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the names
of some analagous Islamic groups?)  

When Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her
Christianity, I believe her.  Her form of theism ascribes to her deity
such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care
for those in need.  The point is that such a philosophy does have the
power to change the behavior of individuals;  if it is widespread
enough, it can change societies.

The same works for the horrors of history.  To claim that Christianity
had little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the
awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute.  What it seems you
are doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never
the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that
religion has had no evil impacts on history.  That is absurd.",0

Well, -I've- been reading t.p.m. for a while and here is what I saw
YOU write:


  >For balance, perhaps you should mention the mosques in Jerusalem that
  >were razed after the Israeli victory in 1967.  An eye for an eye, I guess.

Your statment clearly tries to ""balance"" Arab atrocities by noting a
single incident by the Israelis in war-time at their most holy site.
You even characterize it as ""an eye for an eye"".  


  >That would be false.  If you read your history, you will learn that
  >right after the 1967 war, the victorious Israelis decided to raze a
  >section of the newly captured East Jerusalem, near the Wailing Wall.
  >It is in this section that mosques were razed.

so now you have to find some source that notes that more than 1 mosque
was razed.  You then followed it with:

  >This episode is an example of a good government running amok with
  >newly acquired power.  

Really?  Do you still feel that Israelis are comparable in the running
amok with power with, say, the Iraqis?  Your ""eye for an eye""
comparisons don't match the realities that most of us are familiar
with.


This happened to be during a war!  And a fierce and mighty war it was,
too.  Would you say that the Jordanians ""indiscriminately shot up
ancient structures as is their custom"" in describing bullet holes in
the walls of the city?  This was war!  It was certainly not any ""eye
for an eye"" characterstic.  Israelis do not harbor the same feelings
of revenge as the Arabs generally do.  This is one of the reasons that
the Peace Now movement exists in Israel and nowhere else in the M.E.

# While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, they
# repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and
# attempt to starve the Gazans.

  Why do I detect the faint scent of bias here?  Could it be because
  the Israelis aren't feasting?  Perhaps because the Gazans aren't
  starving?

# The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population
# density in the world,

  Oh, oh.  I hadn't realized that the Chinese had wiped out Hong
  Kong, or that Singapore had sunk into the sea, or that several
  other cities had vanished.  Either that, or this is a taste of
  the quality of 'Research' we're about to see.

#                       has been cut off from the world for weeks.

  So I suppose that the footage on CNN last night was archival,
  and Ted Turner was faking it after the NBC style?  Or is this
  another wee little exaggeration for the sake of a Greater Truth?

# The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
# Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the
# strip and seek work in Israel.

  Hey!  You forgot that Israel has also denied Syrians the same
  'right'.  Come to think of it, Mexico is denying me that 'right'
  evan as I write this!  Or are you ever so gently suggesting that
  Israel, unlike every other country on Earth, shouldn't be allowed
  to control traffic across its borders?

# While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the
# Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help
# the Gazan resistance.  The only help given to Gazans by Israeli
# Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.

  This sounds like a parallel, but it isn't.  Tell us how many Poles
  went into the Ghetto to join the Jews there.  Oops!  For a moment
  there I forgot that in Poland, 'humanitarian assistance"" could
  get you killed.  Come to think of it, humanitarian assistance to
  the Gazans can get Israelis killed, too.  Except that in Gaza,
  it's likely to be by a Gazan death squad in your own office.

  So let's keep the parallel.  Since the gross numbers aren't the
  same, we'll need a proportionality value.  Should we use:
    * Gazan vs Jewish initial population?
    * Gazan vs Jewish death rates?
    * Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation?
    * Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the 'resistance'?
    * Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims?
  Since the two cases are so comparable, it shouldn't matter
  which we pick, they'll all be about the same, right?

------------

Contrary to popular hyperbole, the IDF *could* quite easily kill
off the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to.
(No, I'm not exaggerating.  And I really don't want to discuss how.)
Note that a million dead Gazans don't get much more headline
space than a dozen, and are just as soon forgotten -- and once
exterminated, they can't keep popping up as headlines.

So if a ""Final Solution"" for Gaza would be so much better from
a *Realpolitik* standpoint, why doesn't Israel go for it?  A
difficult question to answer for those who can't believe anything
good about Jews, and probably why they keep trying to force-fit
the facts into the theory.

I hope there is not one- with a subject like this you just have a spiral.  What
would then be a morality of a morality of morals.  Labels don't make arguments. 
One really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be
interpreted, even though this would hardly seem moral.  For example ""The best
thing for me is to ensure that I will eat and drink enough.  Hence all actions
must be weighed against this one statement.""  whatever helps this goal is
""moral"", whatever does not is ""immoral""

Of course this leads such a blank space: there are so many different ways to
fulfill a goal, one would need a ""hyper-morality"" to apply to just the methods.


Seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think
about it long enough  :)  On the other hand, maybe it is our first gut
reaction...  Which?  Who knows: perhaps here we have a way to discriminate
morals.  I don't instinctively thing vegetarianism is right (the same way I
instinctively feel torture is wrong), but if I thought about it long enough and
listened to the arguments, I could perhaps reason that it was wrong (is that
possible!?  :) )  See the difference?

The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink. I would say NO. After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra, so I didn't see any problems. The room temperatur was 22 Celsius (72 F). If you living in a area were it is hot 100 F (45 C) and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side.

They were attacking the Iraqis to drive them out of Kuwait,
a country whose citizens have close blood and business ties
to Saudi citizens.  And me thinks if the US had not helped out
the Iraqis would have swallowed Saudi Arabia, too (or at 
least the eastern oilfields).  And no Muslim country was doing
much of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi
Arabia; indeed, in some masses of citizens were demonstrating
in favor of that butcher Saddam (who killed lotsa Muslims),
just because he was killing, raping, and looting relatively
rich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West.

So how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolled
back the Iraqi invasion, were you in charge of Saudi Arabia???


I think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an
official religion (de facto or de jure), because with human nature
like it is, the ambitious and not the pious will always be the
ones who rise to power.  There are just too many people in this
world (or any country) for the citizens to really know if a 
leader is really devout or if he is just a slick operator.


You make it sound like these guys are angels, Ilyess.  (In your
clarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???)
Friday's New York Times reported that this group definitely is
more conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who
think that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively
enough).  The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the
government was not conservative enough, they have:

	- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom
	  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law
	  brings the death penalty.  

	  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess?

	- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who
	  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on
	  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,
	  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should
	  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as
	  prostitutes.

	  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I've
	  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving
	  has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc.
	  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want
	  these women falsely called prostitutes?  

	  If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely,
	  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind
	  anyone who hates anyone you hate.

	- say that women should not be allowed to work.

	- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.

Now, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government
on earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among
other things.  I just think that the most likely replacements
for them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.
But I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the
last six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing
by the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women
not fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it
sends the wrong signals about your morality).  And I've read that
they've cracked down on the few, home-based expartiate religious
gatherings, and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapers
offering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who
dare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So the
government has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of
the wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition.
As unislamic as some of these things are, they're just a small
taste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of
Saud, like they're trying to in the long run.

Is this really what you (and Rached and others in the general
west-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd)
want, Ilyess?

Death and disease do not respect national boundaries, not as toxins,

piece of turf, we are merely contending for the best vantage point
from which to kill others, ""our"" land and eventually ourselves.

I'm not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism.  Maybe it's fair to ask
whether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure that
all _my_ ancestors (hah!) labored to produce.  But it's an artificial
distinction: is the recent immigrant, even a refugee, less likely to
contribute to the next generation's legacy than anyone else?  [In
history the reverse is often the case: recent immigrants strive
hardest.  If nothing else, they fill open eco(l/n)ogic niches.]

Then again, my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe, so I can
understand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off.  While I, of

so.  That'll prove my moral superiority, by golly, as well as the

About 2 years ago, there was a lot of noise about a Church in the Old
City of Jerusalem being taken over by a Jewish group.  In fact, the
building in question was a dormitory that belonged to a church and was 
not physically connected to any church.  It had been leased to a
Palestinean Arab for 99 years and a Jewish group sub-leased it from
him.  The church that owned the building disapproved and legal action
was started to revoke the sub-lease.  The media, however, made it look
like Jewish vigilantes were stealing Church property in Jerusalem by
force. 


The damage has already been done by the press in the above case.  It
is not surprising by now, of course, that many ""decent people"" regard
the press ""with utmost suspicion"".

"Hello Folks,

I'm very happy with my ""new"" R80GS.  My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...
that's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting
something rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much
anyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it's more a 
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still
(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe
I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion
a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are 
my questions:

1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep the
wind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds
(70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my
vision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece 
detachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.

2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it 
really picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the 
headlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternators
don't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm
puttering around in the dirt at low RPM?  

3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing
in the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section
of the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing? 

4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline
with alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep
the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any 
particular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?

I don't necessarily disagree with your assertion, but I disagree with
your reasoning.  (Faith = Bad.  Dogma = Bad.  Religion -> (Faith ^ Dogma).
Religion -> (Bad ^ Bad).  Religion -> Bad.)  Unfortunately, you never 
state why faith and dogma are dangerous.  

If you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in
Waco, you are missing the point.  

The Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the
messenger.  They believed Koresh was a prophet, and therefore believed
everything he said.  The problem wasn't the religion, it was the 
followers.  They didn't die because of faith and dogma, they died because
of their zealotry (or, in the case of the children, the zealotry of their
parents).


So Christians are totally irrational?  Irrational with respect to their
religion only?  What are you saying?  One's belief in a Christian God does
not make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at,
but I'd rather hear you expand on the subject.



Again, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of
being a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in
God is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists
would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a
God which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?





So, Christianity is a prison, eh?  Ever heard of parole?  You have read far
too much into this subject.  A Christian is one who follows the religion
based on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ.  Nowhere does this
definition imply that one cannot change one's mind.  In prison, however,
you can't just decide to leave.  One is voluntary, the other is not.  The
two are not compatible.



I prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine. 8^)
Seriously, though, some (but certainly not all) religions do condemn
groups of people.  The common target is the ""infidel,"" a curious being
who is alternately an atheist, a non-<insert specific religious
affiliation here>, a person of a different race, or an Egyptian. 8^)

Please explain how ""just because"" thinking kills people.  (And please

"Wm Hathaway comments;



I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to
impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to
somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment
of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded
by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be
sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least,
our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts
that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out,
not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all
of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach
that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the
'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally
unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern
sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal.
I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that,
just because it has changed the way we strive.

BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.  Sometimes they make
it better.

Cam,

Several months ago I bought a 4/40 PB100 with external floppy, AppleTalk
Remote Access, a Kensington case and AC adapter with complete documentation
and in almost new condition, used for US$900. I considered it a very good
buy and am very *cosy* with my little baby now... :-)

"This response originally fell into a bit bucket.  I'm reposting it
just so Bill doesn't think I'm ignoring him.


Bill,

I'm sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to
this.

Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; I think
many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ.  Your generalisms
are then misplaced -- atheism needn't imply materialism, or the lack
of an absolute moral system.  However, I do tend to materialism and
don't believe in absolute morality, so I'll answer your questions.


An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according
to a personal understanding of morality.  That I don't believe in an
absolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one.  I'm just explicit,
as in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express
judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code
rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.
My moral code is not particular different from that of others around
me, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I
object to genocide, I'm not expressing anything particularly out of
line with what my society holds.

If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it
does, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral
code is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity
probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of
our ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving
considerable survival advantages.  You'd probably say that God just
made the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a
common understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it
from your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early
childhood teaching.


I think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in
prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're
saying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as ""God
commanded the genocide of the Canaanites"" is mechanistic, but of
course I think that's true of you as well.  My reaction has little to
do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but
if a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him
good, which is supposedly an attribute of God.


Hmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I
have as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In
fact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by
framing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear
that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt
to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the
quality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters
coexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An
absolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a
Bible they happen to agree with, and say ""this is good"", even if the
act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in
the discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as
""excluded from discussion"", such that they ""cannot participate"", and
their opinions given ""no weight whatsoever"" is the lowest form or
reasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort
of someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right,
wrong, and the Bible.

"I always believed the statement 'those who do not know their history
are condemned to repeat it (Will Durant ?), but I am beginning to
believe the opposite is true.

Here in t.p.m and in other newsgroups it seems that history is
mainly remembered to foment hatred or to be used as a club. In the
history of my own people there are ample acts of shame, both done
by my people and done to my people. Since I was not party to any
of those acts, I refuse to accept blame for the evil acts that my
ancestors committed, nor do I direct hatred toward the descendants
of those who committed evil acts against my ancestors.

Will all of this discussion rebuild a single mosque? Will it rebuild
the Temple? Somehow I doubt that it will.

A post in another group, on the Bosnian war, asked us all to love
each other, that love would conquer hate. Sadly, I remember a TV
interview with a young woman in Sarajevo (sp?) who was as I remember,
a former olympic calibre contestant in the rifle shoot. She was now
trying to pick-off Serbian snipers. During the communist years she
had married a Serb, who was now fighting against her people. So it
seems that hate will conquer love.

Is there an odd chance that we might all forget past wrongs and try
and see how we might all live together? It's a damn small planet,
which we have come very close to turning into a radioactive ball,
glowing softly in space. We seem to have been spared that prospect,
shall we now bathe it in each other's blood?

According to MacWeek of 2-22-93:

The Cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the Quadra
800, while the Tempest will share the low-slung case of the Centris
610. Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted
above the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take
pictures of objects or documents. Taking advantage of the 32-bit
digital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards,
the camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels,
with 256 gray levels, on the screen.

Users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record
detail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. The camera
is expected to cost between $150 and $250.

The systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple's
Casper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will have
to purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone.

The two models will talk as well as listen. A new system facility
called the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by
applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.

The Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and support
for up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking an
FPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that will
require a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards.
Users will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the
Cyclone's.",1

   _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
   no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have
   to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to
   ""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching
   by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
   least it was a good try...

So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances?
Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star
hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for
implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of
models.

A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came
through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this
paper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject
line 
  get 9304001


Here is the abstract of that paper.

   The currently favored explanation for the origin of \GRBs puts them
   at cosmological distances;
   but as long as there is no distance
   indicator to these events all possible sources which are
   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is
   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,
   although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs
   from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs
   originate in the solar cometary cloud
   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.

   We use the available data on the distribution of \GRBs (the BATSE
   catalogue up to March, 1992), and
   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to
   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations
   between the angular distributions of \GRBs and comets' aphelia,
   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,
   at least to some extent, true variations
   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\vov$
   test to both distributions.",3

"Several weeks ago, I described a problem with my Apple High-Resolution
monitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail. To
recapitulate: Occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor
momentarily loses sync. The entire raster image bounces down about an
eighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. This usually happens right
after I close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that
radically alters the image on the screen. Sometimes, though, it happens
with no provocation whatsoever.

I have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme was
a man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the
problem was that the 13"" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always
keep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from
a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's
power supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was
really wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that
it had to be endured.)

This seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to
adopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13"" monitor
owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the 
Apple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading
Jitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacement
of a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that,

It is certainly much harder to ""reach compromise"" (or, even sit down

If you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in
a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether
anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near
future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.


You'd almost certainly use air.  Given that you have to pressurize with
*something*, safety considerations strongly suggest making it breathable
(even if the servicing crew is using oxygen masks for normal breathing,
to avoid needing a ventilation system, it's nice if the hangar atmosphere

Jonathan, interesting questions.  Some wonder whether or not the moon could
have ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what
our geology/environmental sciences friends think.

As for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms
of altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)
is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.
This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high
altitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by
helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on
Mount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak
without oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because
if you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably
pass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So
this is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be
limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher
pressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and
could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the
bends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of
pressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in
front of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes
toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen
narcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like
taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet
under water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I
am not a diving expert).

Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere
is too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition,
the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a 
pressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?",3

There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians.
The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina'
or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument.
The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun
cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).


 6. On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'.

 7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya 'Armeniya'.

According to Karakashian:

As for 'Armenia', the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians,
this is more recent than the word 'Ararat', and is to be found used in
the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'.  

Saint Martin:

The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all
the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians
as 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs
as Ermeniyye.
 
Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap'
which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to a
place, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, 
while 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and 
therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'.

G. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary ""Haik""
is the diminutive form of ""Hai"", and that ""Hai"" is the name of our
nation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word ""Armen"" that
foreigners apply to our people.'

It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is 
the name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way
connected with the word 'Hai'.

Haik and Haiastan:

Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom
the Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance
between the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and,
in any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of
Khoren.

Haiasa:

The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were
no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the 
region known as Armenia.

Professor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite
inscriptions for Upper Armenia.'

Yensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is
identical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is a
Hittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown
that 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'.

Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with 
no success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.

The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious
that we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'.

Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and
'Haiastan' entered our older works.

According to Karakashian: 

'The word ""Haik"" is never to be found employed with reference to a
leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it
ever found employed in the forms ""Haika"" or ""Haykazn"".

Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he
improved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred
to a nation and had been derived from ""Hai"" or ""Haik"" they could 
also have used the words ""Haikak"" and ""Haykazn"" in a number of
places.'

According to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite 
inscriptions:

'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality
or species. The words ""Haddanas"", ""Haddina"" were used by the 
Assyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the
""d"" between the two ""a"" letters to ""y"" ""Hadinasdani"" was in this
way transformed to ""Haiastan""'.

Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards
the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai'
and 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a 
solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa' 
which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.
Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case
it seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The
suffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', which
refers to the country of the 'Hayasas'.

E. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological 
and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.

The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost
all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,
above average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties
with certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.

According to J. Deniker:

From the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be
regarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are 
descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their
average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.
They are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of 
85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic
family.

Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows:

The Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,
but some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little
above average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often
a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. 

Investigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between
Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics
led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a 
distinct race.

"Picture our universe floating like a log
in a river.  As the log floats down the
river, it occasionally strikes rocks, the
bank, the bottom, other logs.  When this collission
occurs, kinetic energy is translated into heat, the
log degrades, gets scraped up, and other energy 
translaions occur.  The distribution of damage to
the log depends on the shape of the log.

However, to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a
termite in the center of the log, the shock waves from the
collissions would appear uniformly random in direction.

This is my theory for GRB.  They are evidence of our universe
interacting with other universes!  Why not!  Makes

the law of return.  By conversion, you've elected not to be a part of the
Jewish nation.



At the moment you converted, you officially anounced to the world that *you* do not
consider yourself to be part of the Jewish Nation.  So, why should the Jewish Nation
consider you to be a member?



No.  As a result of wars brought by the Arabs against the Jews in an attempt to
annihilate Israel, the Arabs have lost their claim to land there.  Attacking Israel
is/was illegal and they now have to pay the price.  Do I feel sorry for the
Palestinians?  Yes I do.  But I blame the Arab nations for their problems, not
Israel.

"I just put a 33MHz 040 CPU into my Centris 610.  Now I have a math coprocessor,

If I may offer a constructive criticism, perhaps you should decide if you
love vehicles or the use they are put to. I, myself, think the F-86 is
a beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, I wouldn't even think of flying
it in combat today. Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles
on how they perform.


Not to this degree.


Why?


Your wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has
the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle
isn't reusable, it's salvagable).


The flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X
shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.


The final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight
envelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available
thrust and still land safely.


Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same
thing. Shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design, SSTO is.


You don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You
wouldn't for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for
harmful side effects would you?


You are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit, it
will still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do
need to do to build SSTO.


Again, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout
the flight envelop. Shuttle doesn't. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle isn't.


Not true. Build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will
carry passengers.


I would suggest you talk to the DC-X crew themselves. Their original
schedule had an operational DC-1 flying in 96.


Your ignoring the dammage it does. Mannes space has a reputation for being
unreliable and hugely expensive. Shuttle supporters only make it easy for
opponents of manned space to kill it.


The only way to prove those things is to build it.

From the Pluto Fast Flyby Instrument definition research anouncemnet,
the instrument payload constraints are:
    Mass allocation -  7 kilograms (15.4 lbs)
    Power allocation - 6 watts
    Required instruments:
	Visible imaging system (1024x1024 CCD, 750 mm fl, f/10 optics)
	IR mapping spectrometer (256x256 HgCdTe array, 0.3% energy resolution)
	UV spectrometer (55-200 nm, 0.5 nm resolution)
	Radio science (ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system)
		ultrastable means 10^-14.

This doesn't leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated
to the  mission of the spacecraft.  In addition, the power will come
from a radioisotope thermal generator, and the whole space craft will
be about 2 feet in diameter, with no booms, which means there will be
strong gamma-lines from Pu-239 and associated schmutz in the
background, which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat.

It would still be nice, and our group here at Goddard is looking
in to it.

Look nobody asked those countries about their UN forces
to be on the ground.  They can take their forces which are
incomponent and ineffective at the first place.  And let whoever are
willing to do the job what it takes.  How anyone can defend this
stinking UN force on the ground who let the Bosnnian PM
yanked out from the UN vehicle and being shot by the Serbian
military?  How anyone can defend this UN force who are just watching
the shelling on cities and towns everyday?  How anyone can
defend and say those stinking UN forces being effective
when Bosnian had almost 14,000 children casualties between 5-14 age 
groups?  I think talking about the current UN forces to Bosnian
muslims is just an insult to their casualties.   

I think Senator Biden said it all what has to be said on this issue.
Europe is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this 
world.  Like Biden said, they are the bigots when it comes to 
cultural difference and minorty closer to their home.
Because they get rid of their minorities long long time
ago starting in 15th centuries.  And they let Adolph
to take care of the rest in 20th Century.  But he was much more 
naughty than they expected because he dared to step many 
toes.  So, why spoil the good thing now when Serbs doing today what

I'll vote for anything where they don't feel constrained to use stupid
and ugly PC phrases to replace words like 'manned'.  If they think
they need to do that, they're more than likely engaging in 'politics
and public relations as usual' rather than seriously wanting to

Look up the facts first, post second.  Bernadotte was assassinated
in September 1948 by Lehi under the orders of its three commanders
(one of whom was Yitzhak Shamir).  There is no hard evidence of
complicity of the Israeli government despite some effort by the UN
and other organizations (US intelligence, Swedish government) to
find it.  However a great fuss was made over the apparent lack of
zeal of the Israeli government to track down the killers.  The Lehi
man who actually pulled the trigger later became a personal friend
of David Ben-Gurion.  The best published account in English is A. Ilan, 
Bernadotte in Palestine, 1948 (Macmillan, 1989).

1. If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the
monitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go
from the monitor to the back of the computer.

2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in 
x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,
the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations.

x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million 
Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. 
You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, 
the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide, 
tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against 
the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and 
deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

Sorry, Fred, but for the purposes under discussion here, I must
disagree.  Your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue
against communism by reference to the Chinese or Soviet empires, since
those did not represent *true* communism.  In judging the practical
consequences of Islam as a force to contend with in the world today,
it is precisely the Khomeini's of the world, the Rushdie-fatwa
supporters, and perhaps more importantly, the reaction of the world
Muslim community to those extremists, that we must look to.  Perhaps
unfortunately from your perspective, most people are not concerned
with whether Islam is the right religion for them, or whether the
Qur'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia, but how
Islam affects the world around them, or what their lives might be like
if Islam gains in influence.  When I consider such possibilities, it
is with not inconsiderable fear.",0

I do not want to convince anyone. This is just USENET, not the real
world. I just read the opinions others have about a subject, and sometimes
I present my opinion. I think that this net is only useful to exchange
ideas. I never wanted nor I want now to convince anyone of anything.



First, and I repeat it, I never said that the idea of Jews having the
right to have a State is racist.
Zionism, as a movement, is more than just that idea. I think that Zionism
in the way it defines who is a Jew, for example, is racist-like.
In the same way I believe that Irish have a right to nationalism but I do
not support the bombing and killing of the IRA, I believe that Jews have
a right to nationalism but I do not support Zionism as it is right now.


That is what makes the basis for Zionist movements. However, I am not 
considering just that, but the rest of it. 


Which makes an interesting point. People living in a Jewish State have
shown that Jewish culture includes in it Jewish religion but they are
not the same. So, the Jewish people living in the Jewish State have shown 
us that there are some problems in a State where 80% of the people is secular
but Judaism is define according to religious standards, or where marriage
is a religious stage, or where the Law of Return defines a Jew according to
a religious standard.
Did those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become 
non-Jews? Why should they still define then a Jew based on what is a 
religious definition?





According to Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Inc,
Publishers, Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A., 1986, page 593, 

hy-poc-ri-sy: A feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not.

So, saying that one believes in Zionism as a simple matter of people 
having the right to nationalism, but disregarding the right of the Palestinian
people to do the same, according to this dictionary, is hypocrisy.



I know what my words mean. I do stand by what I said I believe: Zionism is
a form of racism. Of course, I tend to talk about things as they are and
not as they are defined in a broad sense.

	HOW TO GET A VERBAL WARNING FOR 146 IN A 55

It's simple.  First, it has to be the first really nice riding day
of spring.  The bike is back together again, and so are you.  Grab
all your gear, put it on, and fill the tank with 94 octane premium
or better.  Head out.

	In Ames, there is a road that leads to the little town of
Gilbert.  Gilbert has one stop light, if that tells you something.
Having just gotten the bike back together, I thought I'd take it
for a short ride and check things out.  Heading out of town, I
went into the twisties at a slow pace, just under the speed limit,
and started leaning around.  The pace quickened as everything felt
just right.  Finally, the road straightened and I was ready for a
bit of speed.  Grab third gear, open her up.  At roughly 90mph
grab fourth gear.  Look at as much of the bike as you can, and fail
to notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind.  Twist
the throttle like a fool, grab fifth gear at 130 or so, and see
just how well she's been put back together.

	At 146 (according to radar) I noticed the front fender was
flexing a bit.  Thus, I slowed, pulled off the road, removed my
helmet and gloves, unslung the took kit I was carrying in a fanny
pack, and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper
pulled in all hot and flustered.

	""Have you *ANY* idea how fast you were going?""
""Not precisely, no.  I was paying attention to the bike and road,
not the instruments.  I just got her back together last night, and
I'm just out here testing her out before I ride it in traffic.""
	""My radar says you were at over 145mph.  Care to tell me why
I shouldn't give you a ticket?""
""Because I was testing the motorcycle away from population and
traffic, on a strait and flat road, while wearing all the protective
gear that safety demands?"" (note: I wasn't quite that eloquent)
	""Say, what kind of bike is that, anyway?""
<I was eloquent on my cafe racer replica Honda 750, a Rat Bike>
	""Yeah, I haven't had my bike out of the garage in years.""
<compare riding stories>
<pack toolkit, having tightened that fender>
	""So why were you out here?""
""I figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through
me.  If the bike fails somehow in a 35mph zone, I'm dead.  If it holds
up out here, then I know it will work right in traffic.  I do this
evvery year when I rebuild her.""
	""Not any more.  You'll find a better place than *my* highway
to do those speeds.  If I *ever* catch you speeding on my highway
again I'm going to nail you for everything I possibly can.  Now get
out of my sight before I write you a ticket.""
""Yes, officer.""
	""And kid, keep your eyes open out there..."" <drives off>

	And that, in a nut-shell, is how to get a warning for 146 in a 55.
I don't guarantee that it will work for you, but it worked for me.",2

good point.  the ""list"" actually started out as an extension of my GS

however, other boxer-interested folks have joined and the conversation
has not always been ""geared"" to gs/pd/st-specific topics.


when i raised the ""to expand or not to expand/that is the question""
question on the list itself, there were mixed feelings.  the list has
always been open to anyone with a non-bouncing ""from:"" line and there
has been general agreement that only boxer-related stuff is
appropriate.  almost all of the subscribers own R80/R100 GS/ST/PD
bikes, although some R, RT and RS owners are also on it.

at this point, my main interest for the list is to preserve the peace
and comraderie while at the same time providing as wide access as
possible.  the list is fairly technical, with ""how do i do this?"",
""what kind of that should i get?"" kinds of questions.  there has yet
to be any non-BMW bashing, K bike bashing, or ""any bmw mfg'd after
1962 is a piece of shit"" bashing.  such posts are, by consent of the

[BH] Tsiel,

[BH] I would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border,
[BH] starting from the early 70's.  Certainly the PLO did shell Northern
[BH] Israel from the Arqoub region, but Israel did much more shelling
[BH] destroying several South Lebanese villages.  At the very least
[BH] we can say that both sides exchanged shelling, with occasional
[BH] aerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages.
[BH] In any case Steve's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in 
[BH] response to years of shelling from Lebanon is false.  Israel had
[BH] many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government
[BH] in Lebanon favorable to Israel, and it nearly achieved this aim
[BH] with the election of Basheer El Gemayel, and his brother, Amin
[BH] El Gemayel, but the internal situation in Lebanon was too hard
[BH] to control and predict so Israel had to withdraw, and Amin El Gemayel
[BH] had to abrogate the 17 th of May Agreement.

Basil,

I was only correcting Steve's statement that Geurillas were shelling Israel
from the Golan, which was absurd.
The fact that ""Israel did much more shelling"" was in response to Palestinian
shelling from Lebanon. Israel has no intention of keeping an inch of Lebanese
territory. Israel will continue to fight Hizbullah, PLO, FPLP etc. as long as
its northern border is not quiet. If the Lebanese army can control these 
elements then I think we can see genuine peace on the Israel-Lebanese border.
I remind you that a couple thousand Lebanese cross each day into Israel to 
work.
As for the election of Bashir Gemayel, it is true that he was favorable to
Israel, is that why the Syrians killed him? His brother Amin was a Syrian 
puppet, if he had not been, he would have been dead by now.

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for

  These Armenian volunteers committed all kinds of excesses, more
  than six hundred thousand Kurds being killed between 1915 and 1916 in

 were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after
 being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part

THE NEW VICE-PREMIER PLANS TO INTENSIFY THE WORK ON THE ATTRACTION OF
WESTERN INVESTMENTS

  BAKU (MAY 19) TURAN: Yesterday, Rasul Guliyev, the recently appointed
Vice-Premier of the republic, received the US ambassador in Azerbaijan,
Richard Miles. As ""Azerbaijan"" newspaper informs, the issue of attraction
of western investments in Azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. In
particular, Gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in
the most profitable spheres of manufacture. He also noticed, that the number
of the priority manufactures will be released from debts. 
Guliyev also said that intensifying the activities of the American oil 
companies will promote the strengthening of the American-Azeri relations.


THE PROPOSAL TO SUMMON SPECIAL SESSION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET IS REJECTED AGAIN

   Baku (May 19) Turan: Yesterday, in the sitting of the Milli Mejlis,
the chairman, Isa Gambar, rejected the proposal of the deputy Arif
Rahimzade to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan.
  This written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates. But
the chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't
be submitted for discussion.
   Earlier, the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon
a special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy for
the Parliament, Rahimzade, doesn't consider that the deputates have the 
objective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns the
serious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of the
republic's authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament,
ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion
on these questions.
   The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago,
when it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power.
   The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50
deputates (25 ""democrats"" and 25 ""partocrates""). At that time ""democrats"" and
""partocrates"" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn't exist for a long 
time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time,
the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon
a session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity out
of the Parliament. --0--


THE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA

    Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreement
between Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign 
Minister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics,
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18. 
The group of experts is headed by Tikht Reiman, the chief of the Ministry of
Economics of Estonia.
   The MIA of Azerbaijan informed Turan agency, that in their stay in Baku,
the delegation will also visit Ministry of Economics and National Bank of the
republic.--0--


AZERBAIJAN DOES NOT INTEND TO JOIN THE CIS COMMON ECONOMIC ZONE

   Baku (May 19) Turan: Deputy prime-ministers of the republic, Vahid
Ahmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan wouldn't join the CIS
common economic zone.
   Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a 
common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic. 
According to Abbas Abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted for
the discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14, has a number
of unfavorable points for Azerbaijan.
   Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the
background of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of
the Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic
zone.--0--


THE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW

     Baku (May 19) Turan: Today, Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director
of the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republic
along with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow to
hold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan. 
According to the preliminary information, the credit will be 50 billion rubles.
    As press-centre of Ministry of Finance informed Turan's correspondent, 
precise amount of the credit, conditions of its repay and a number of other
questions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in
Moscow. It is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling
of industrial enterprises of Azerbaijan and Russia.
    When the sides reach the agreement, it is proposed for signing by the end 
of May.--0--


AZERBAIJAN WILL REPLY TO THE SECOND VARIANT OF TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BY 26 OF
MAY

     Baku (May 19) Turan: On the measures for peace presented by Russia,
Turkey and the USA to Azerbaijan and Armenia, the representative of the
president of Azerbaijan in the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, Asim Gasimov noted
that the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant.
     ""Just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by 
insistence of the Armenian side. We do not intend to come back to the analysis
of the schedule, because we have given a positive answer to it on May 6"",- said
Gasimov.
     The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just
began to work on the examination of the commentary, and their answer would be 
given as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 26.
     As it is known, the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by
Armenia, which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0--


THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

   BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The Azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced
that the Russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 Russian soldiers 
condemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court, as innocent
people is unjustified.
    Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves,
prove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units
and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit, where they
served.
    The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers
as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also 
unfounded. For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the
list of one of the military unit's of Russian commandos in Yerevan.
   Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of
the Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the
Russian community. Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that this
type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0--


AZERBAIJAN'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE
SIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS

     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijan
is considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six
accused soldiers' fortune. In particular, the offer to send the representatives
of the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation
to Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers' case will
be directed to Russian parliament.
     According to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give
Russian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the
investigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have
given rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation
in the war against Azerbaijan.


ARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE ""KARABAKHS"" ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS

     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of 
Armenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies
on the territories of Rostov, Stavropol and Krasnodar regions, - reported the
newspaper ""Russky vestnik"" on March 9, 1993 published in Geneva.
     The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the 
documents of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of ""reunion"" of
the North Caucasus and ""Armenia proper"" at present, the front is appealing to 
the UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider the
need to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus.
     To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary to
carry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity ""identical to
those in Nagorno Karabakh"". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian
national-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of
Armenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus 
instructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.
     Thus according to the newspaper ""Russky vestnik"", ""new Karabakhs"" are 
being planning on the North Caucasus. --O--


STATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT

     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary of
Azerbaijan, Ali Kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural
centers was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the president
Elchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and
culture of national minorities adopted on September 16, 1992 were considered. 
     The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a
legal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership
of Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all 
nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.
     The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy,
Hidayat Orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the ""undeclared
war"" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many 
problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic
groups. 
     For today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of
Justice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture 
and means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign
diplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of
free accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary). 
     As it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted
to create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North of
Azerbaijan where Lezghins live, a national Lezghin theater was opened, 
radiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of the
educational literature for Talyshs, Tats, Lezghins and Kurds and national
teaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences
of Azerbaijan.--O-- 


MEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED

     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State 
concern ""Azerineft"", the Memorandum of understanding with the companies
""AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum"", ""Bi-Pi Exploration Operating"", ""Pennzoil
Caspian"", ""Unocal Khazar Ltd."", ""McDermott"" and Turkish oil corporation on
mutual extracting of fields ""Azeri"", ""Chirag"" and ""Gyuneshli"" was signed. 
According to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common
program of activity was created. 
     According to the president of ""Azerineft"", Sabit Bagirov, cooperation
will provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently. 
     During the project, the main principles will be the effective use of
oil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of
exploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the
exploitation of these fields. 
The memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical
and political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas
fields. --O--


ARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS

     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on 
six Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh,
Armenian propaganda has become actively involved.
     The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin
with a request ""to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian
soldiers"". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedings
on the case in Baku as ""a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia"".
     The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one could
believe the Yerevan agency ""Snark"", the Armenians in Karabakh presented
an ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatum
is that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners in
Karabakh will be shot dead.
     It is simple to explain such ""touching attitude of Armenians"" to
the six Russian soldiers' fate. If by chance the sentence is executed
it will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accused
Russian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister
of Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.
     If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of its
saving of lives of ""innocent Russians"". --O--


NEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA

     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry of
Azerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijan
from the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.
     The day before, the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag, Shotaraz,
Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire from
Kafan district of Armenia. Two inhabitants were wounded, there were
destructions in the villages.
     On May 20, the firing on the villages of Bashkend, Mutudere,
Shynykh, Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district of
Azerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was in
progress.
     At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of
Armenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan, penetrated
into the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan, killed two
shepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take a
flock across the frontier. Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--O--


""UNOCAL"" COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN

     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed by the
representation of UNOCAL American oil company, the leaders of this
company decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of
50 houses for refugees.
     At present, the American side suggested a village project for 
consideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan. The project
is a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary
accommodations and so on.
     According to the program the construction and putting into
operation of the village will be this year. --O--


MANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE

     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: Lately, at the black market of Baku, the
national currency - Manat, fell in price compared with the Russian
Ruble. Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar.
Taking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with 
respect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value
10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble is
the same at banks, state establishments and in trade.
     According to the representatives of the business circles and
experts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles
are bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financial
operations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republics
of the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmen
arrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business 
with Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much 
Rubles in cash the businessmen need. --O--


THE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY

    Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president's decree, the
expert group, including representatives of the Parliament and 
presidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitution
of the Republic of Azerbaijan. This must be adopted by Milli Mejlis before
the Parliamentary elections. Together with this, the work on the new
Constitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new Parliament of
the country, is going on. The newsmen were informed about the work on the
press-conference of the Supreme Soviet of the republic the day before.
    Parliamentary legal experts, Safa Mirzoyev, Simran Hasanov and 
representatives of the department of the president's apparatus Fazil Mustafaev
and Shahin Aliev took part in the press-conference.
    The national discussion of the project of the Parliamentary
election law is going on at present. According to Simran Hasanov the bill
didn't cause any objections. It was noted, that until now, no alternative
variant of the election law was put forward.
   The newsmen were also informed, that Parliamentary commissions
will examine all coming proposals till June 10. By June 15 all
proposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in Milli Mejlis.--0--


ISA GAMBAR SUGGESTS THAT AZERI-RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT COMMISSION FOR 
CLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BE CREATED

   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: The Chairman of the Milly Mejlis of the
Azerbaijan republic, Isa Gambar, sent the return letter to the Chairman
of the Russian Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov in connection with
the conviction of the Russian servicemen lieutenant V.Semion, sergeant
K. Tukish, M.Lisov and A.Filipov by the military college of the
Supreme Court of Azerbaijan.
   In his letter, Isa Gambar suggested that the commission of Azerbaijan
Milly Mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the Russian Supreme
Soviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal
case. In his view, ""the conclusion of the commission could help in the 
objective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problems
in the future. But the main thing is, it could help to promote the
knowledge about involvement of the Russian servicemen in crime"".
   In its turn, in connection with the Russian parliament message,
Milly Mejlis adopted a resolution on May 19, according to which the
permanent commissions on government building and legal policy, human
rights and international relations are charged with the exploration of
this problem.--0--


WILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED?

      Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representative
to the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the 
Trilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with
the representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in case
the peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself.
     Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authors
of the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership is
paving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from
the peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia and
US having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partial
US departure from Transcaucasia.--0--


FATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER

   Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company,
Sabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development of
oil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer.
As it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL-
RAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspian
fields.
   According to the plan, SOCAR and BP-STATOIL are to sign a complete
treaty on development of Chirag field on June 16. Later AMOCO and
PENNZOIL will sign treaties.
   Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645
million ton. 310 million of them fall on Azeri field, 180 mln.ton
on Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag.
   The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to
bring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. In addition to the net
economic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West in
the defence of its interests at the international scene.
   As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement ""the May of
1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and its
independence and we have to stand these tests"".--0--

THE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN

   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijan
informs, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of the
Russian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received.
The appeal contains the call ""to display mercy, humanism and clemency 
on the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian Armed
Forces"".
   The authors of the appeal point out, that they don't justify the
participation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people,
don't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denounce
the mercenary according to the UN principals, and they are sorry about the
Russian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.
    At the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers'
mothers' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask the
president of Azerbaijan to ""save those guys"".
   It should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers' mothers,
taking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief only
Russian policy. According to their words, the leaders, that lay down
lives of Russian men to achieve their political aims, must be made
answerable.
    Unfortunately, the appeal didn't mention the grief of the mothers
of Azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced Russian servicemen.--0--


ARMENIAN ARTILLERY CONTINUES FIRING ON AZERI DISTRICTS

     BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: On May 22, two soldiers of National army of
Azerbaijan were killed during the ""Grad"" shelling of the villages of
Kolly Gyshlag, Shaifly, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of

AZERI PRIME-MINISTER IS LEAVING FOR GREAT BRITAIN

  BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : The Minister of Foreign Economic Relations,
Rauf Garayev, in his interview to Turan agency said, that
""Great Britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of Azerbaijan
after Iran"". The business cooperation between the two countries
develops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oil
extraction equipment, communication and agriculture.
  According to the Minister's words, the forthcoming visit of
Azerbaijani Prime-Minister, Panah Huseynov, to Great Britain on May
23-24, is very important. It is expected, that the visit will
help, to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branch
offices of some British banks, insurance firms; to conclude
contracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; on
building in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of the
entire communication system of Azerbaijan.
   In Garayev's view, the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britain
will have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan.
   According to politicians and reviewers in Baku, at present, Great
Britain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan. The continuation of
the economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --O--

Peace Talks Resume Today; Israel to Offer Palestinians New
Proposals
 
Israel Radio, KOL YISRAEL, reports on today's resumption in
Washington of the bilateral peace talks, following a recess which
lasted over four months. According to the report, Israel is
expected to offer the Palestinians new proposals regarding the
authority of the Palestinian Executive Council, general elections,
control over land and human rights issues in the Territories.
Israel will express its readiness to give the Palestinians control
of more land than previously offered. According to the radio
report, one estimate is that Israel will give the Palestinians
control over as much as two thirds of the administered lands, as
well as broad authority on water issues. Israel will seek to
promote its offer to hold elections in the Territories in hopes of
strengthening the position of the Palestinian delegation to the
peace negotiations. According to Israel Radio, the Israeli
delegation to the bilateral talks with the Palestinians will offer
greater responsibilities to the Palestinian Executive Council
allowing it certain legislative capabilities, without making it a
symbol for Palestinian sovereignty. U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher invited all the heads of delegations to a gathering
tonight. It will be the first such event since the Madrid
conference. Head of the American team at the bilateral peace talks,
Edward Djerejian, said that tonight's gathering is meant to
demonstrate the U.S.' active role in the peace process.

   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


-Zinaida: On March 20 we arrived in Yerevan, and the next day they registered
us at the train station and took us to the boarding house. The conditions were
wonderful, thanks to our Armenians, who received us. But it's not relaxing all
the same. I don't know how everyone else feels about it, but for me it's 
torture. We don't have a place to call our own. I had a two bedroom apartment 
in Sumgait, my children went to school and we lived well, in friendship. It's 
painful that in our times, in 1988, in the Soviet period, people can break 
into our apartment and try to kill me and my children, in whom I've put all my
efforts and my whole youth. Everything was going well for us: my older 
daughter was studying at the Institute, the middle one was preparing to enter 
medical school and was interning as an orderly, and my youngest had been sick 
for a long time, but had returned to health. I have been though a lot in my 
life: it's been seven years since I lost my husband, I raised my children by 
myself. Lots of women have similar fates, but there's nothing to be done about
it. But I can't control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on 
February 27, 28, and 29, it was just a horror, it's indescribable.

On February 27 our relative, Ira, came to visit us. She's better friends with
my oldest daughter, and so right away she asked, ""Where's Vika?"" I say,
""Vika's off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days, she's supposed to come back
tomorrow."" My middle daughter, Gaya, had baked a cake and we sat there talking
and laughing, drinking tea. Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira home.

They left and a few minutes went by; suddenly I hear noise. I raced out to
the balcony--our balcony is right across from the bus station, we live at the
corner of Mir and Druzhba Streets--I look and see that there are hoards of
people near the bus station and they're all shouting something. What they're
shouting I can't understand. Our neighbor is standing on his balcony, too. I
ask, ""Nufar, what's happened?"" He says, ""I don't know, I can't figure it out
either."" I got scared--the kids had gone outside, and I wanted to run after
them, but then there was a knock at the door. I open the door and it's the
kids. ""Mamma,"" says Gayane, ""you'll never believe what's going on out there! 
It's awful!"" Ira says, ""Aunt Zina, they're shouting, 'Karabagh! Karabagh! 
Karabagh is ours!' We didn't know what was going on. They're threatening to 
drive out the Armenians and slaughter them.""

I called my brother, and his wife answered the phone. I said, ""Aunt Tamara, 
don't worry, Ira is staying here with us, and we'll see her home later."" I 
couldn't shut my eyes all night long, even until morning. I was worried about
Vika. My God, what was going on, what had happened?!

-Gayane: That day, on the 27th, we stood on the balcony and observed what was 
happening, although Mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of it. There weren't 
50 yards between our building and the bus station. We could see and hear 
everything perfectly. They were stopping buses, dragging people out, leading 
all the passengers out, looking for Armenians. If they found an Armenian on 
the bus, then it started . . .I don't know what to call it . . .

-Zinaida: It's called slaughter.

-Gayane: The mob would descend on people and beat them. I don't know if they 
were killing them or not, but when they left them, they lay still, not moving,
as though nothing was left of them. One person was lying there and they 
started dragging him. The police were standing right there, to the side, not 
doing anything, they didn't take any steps to calm that mob.

It was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony. And you 
couldn't go anywhere, somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everything
so as to tell of it later. We wanted to leave Sumgait that day. What kept us
was the idea that we live in the Soviet Union, and that something would be
done about it. Where in the world was our government?!

-Zinaida: We couldn't leave town, of course, because our older daughter wasn't
home. And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana. On Sunday 
morning when I went to see Ira home, our neighbor said, ""Zin', you know they 
went into Valodya's house and smashed everything he had. They murdered his 
father and two sons."" Valodya is our neighbor, he's an Armenian, he lives on 
the first floor. I think, my God, what is happening?! And in broad daylight!

I saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting ""Slay the
Armenians! Karabagh is ours!"" This was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. On the 
way I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says, ""They beat our store
manager, they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him, but he was an 
Azerbaijani."" And I asked, ""Did they kill him?"" She says, ""No, he's in serious
condition."" I left there and started to walk home on that same street, but the
mob started moving in my direction. I turned off the street and went down the 
little way that goes toward the Sputnik store. There I met another crowd, but 
these weren't bandits, these were our people from Sumgait. I was so frightened
that I walked without knowing where was going, I couldn't feel my legs or the 
ground under my feet. I was walking and there was a boy standing before my 
eyes. This was on the 27th, around evening time. He ran under our balcony, and
the mob surged toward him shouting, ""He's an Armenian, get him!"" He wore a 
black coat. They grabbed him, that boy, near the bus stop, I saw it. They 
grabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt.

I made it home but I just couldn't calm down. My oldest daughter was in my 
thoughts. I was thinking, my daughter's coming home now, they'll stop her bus 
and she'll be gone. There's no police, no protection, nothing. It's like they 
had all died, there's no one, nothing, no authorities whatsoever. I can't even
find the words for it! I look and see an Ikarus arriving. Before going to the 
bus station they stop near our place, across from the Kosmos movie theater. So
this Ikarus stops  there and the gang is yelling, the Azerbaijanis are running
toward it yelling, ""Armenians out!"" And I see them take the Armenians and beat
them, killing them. I can't watch it any more. It was a nightmare. I just 
couldn't watch it. But Gaya was standing there watching it, and I scolded her.
She says, ""Mamma, I have to see it, I have to know what's happening, I have to
see it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it later. So our children 
will know.""

Gayane: We saw a great deal on the 27th. They caught no less than 20 people
before my eyes. I can't say for sure if they killed them or not . . .

-Zinaida: There were too many people there, the mob was too big. You couldn't 
make anything out. But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes. He
was 18 or 19 years old.

-Gayane: I think he was older, probably, about 22. A tall fellow, a big guy, 
in a coat. He was walking quickly, but when they shouted that he was an
Armenian, he tore off running. And the mob went after him. They caught him 
right under our balcony. I don't know. I don't think there could have been 
much left of him after that. You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks
one person. It was a mob, big, angry, and featureless. You know, there was a 
similarity in the way they were dressed, mostly they were wearing long black 
coats. You couldn't even tell them apart, they were all wearing black and they
all looked alike.

-Zinaida: When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and 
he cried ""Mamma!"" I ran into the room. I couldn't watch any longer. An awful 
lot was going on right then, in various places, it wasn't only that boy, 
several people were being beaten up. You couldn't see all of it at once, but 
when that boy cried ""Mamma!"" I immediately started watching only him.

-Gayane: On that first day it went on from about six in the morning until
twelve at night. At midnight they dispersed and the police took their place.
They were scattered about in all districts. But how can you explain the fact
that by morning, when it had already started getting light, around seven
o'clock, our police were gone? The police disappeared and yielded their
positions to the bandits. In the morning they started gathering at our inter-
section again, at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown. From
morning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered, and by nine
o'clock you couldn't even see the ground. There were thousands of people in
the crowd. Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians.

-Zinaida: They had signals. I realized that when I noticed that they made a 
cross with their arms, they crossed their arms over their heads. The cross,
evidently, meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it. They let the
Azerbaijani cars through, and they stopped the Armenian ones and started
their pogrom.

-Gayane: They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his 
nationality was. He got out and said they were from Baku. ""But what is your
nationality?"" He says Armenian. They immediately start shouting, ""Ermeni,
Ermeni!"" And he says, ""What's going on? I'm coming from Baku. I don't live
in Sumgait."" ""Doesn't matter, who cares if you're from Baku or Sumgait.""
Anyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him, and they dragged a 
woman--his wife, probably--out of the car. At this point the police came and 
took the two and led them away. Then the mob started smashing the car, and 
then burned it. The flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire! Then everyone 
ran away, they thought the car was going to explode. About 20 minutes later 
another car comes along, a green Moskvich. They ran up shouting ""Ermeni! 
Ermeni!"" But this time they didn't pull the people out of the car, they didn't
beat them. Maybe they burned them along with the car, because no one emerged 
from the flames. The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too, 
acquaintances of his walked by below, and he asked them and they said, ""Yes, 
they burned them along with the car."" About two hours later a whole wedding 
procession came by, and there was a doll on the first car. We thought they 
were Armenians, but the cars started to honk loudly. They were Azerbaijanis, 
and they were immediately allowed through.

-Zinaida: The driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way.' The
whole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely.

-Gayane: By the way, at the marriage hall, which is right in the courtyard
of our building, there was a wedding that day. The Azerbaijanis were cele-
brating and dancing. On the streets there was grief and death, people were
being killed, and people were celebrating the whole time.

-Zinaida: Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and 
find out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive. She went to her 
girlfriend's in the building, she lives in the first entryway, on the third 
floor. Gaya came back and said, ""Mamma, the bus is supposed to come around
eight, after eight."" You can imagine what I was feeling, how hard it was:
Vika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death. 
Then I heard shouting. I raced to the window and see that the belongings of 
our neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors. They were 
thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow. I 
started to cry. I am walking around the room, crying, wailing: Vika's not 
here, what will come of her . . . Gaya, of course, was consoling me: ""Mamma, 
nothing will happen to her, don't worry, calm down, she's in good company, 
they'll look out for her.""

Diana: I saw the green car burn. The car was burning when we went out onto the
balcony. Gaya pushed me away, telling me to get off the balcony. I left. Then 
they came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians here.

-Zinaida: You're right, I forgot about that, that was on the 27th.

Diana: There's a small, grassy area in front of our balcony; there are trees
planted there. The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the building.
All the neighbors said, no, there are no Armenians here. There weren't a lot
of Armenians in our building, but there weren't just a few Armenian families, 
either.

-Gayane: They fell upon the apartments on the 28th. There were terribly many 
of them. Our courtyard is huge, and it was completely filled with them.

-Zinaida: Katusev had made an appearance on television earlier. He said that 
two people, Azerbaijanis, had been killed in Karabagh. And when he said that 
. . . you know how bees sound, have you heard how they buzz? It was like the 
buzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our 
courtyard, howling and shouting. I don't know how to describe it. By this 
point we were afraid to watch from the balcony, but when I looked out of the 
bedroom window--the Znaniye Bookstore is down there, and Armenians live on the 
second and fourth floors--I saw their things being thrown out the windows. I 
realized that they would be upon us any minute. I shouted to Gayane, ""Gaya, 
hide the gold."" That's honestly what I told my child. I grabbed Diana. I 
didn't know what to do! Vika still wasn't home, and it was already getting 
dark. I was afraid to look at the time because I was already horrified as it 
was.

-Gayane: Just in case, we changed the television channel from the Moscow 
station to the Azerbaijani one.

-Zinaida: And turned it up loud.

-Gayane: We never listened to Azerbaijani music. It just didn't do much for 
us. In all those years we almost never listened to it. But sometimes we would
watch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani television. And that was 
it. And here we had it turned up full blast. So they would think we were 
Azerbaijanis.

-Zinaida: Well you can imagine, they're slaughtering Armenians, robbing them, 
and we're listening to this concert music from Baku. Our Azerbaijani neighbors
suggested we do it, they knocked on the door and told Gaya to turn on 
Azerbaijani music. But we already had it on anyway. Turn on the lights, they 
told us, so they will think you're not Armenians. They're saying the Armenians
are afraid to turn on their lights, they're hiding.

-Gayane: Apparently there was some kind of arrangement, because we noticed 
that the lights were off only in Armenian apartments, that is, the 
Azerbaijanis were warned, and every last one of them had their lights on.
When we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately, and
later, another one. ""Turn on the lights,"" they told us, ""please. Nothing will
happen. Be calm. Nothing will happen.""

-Zinaida: ""We won't allow them to come into your apartment.""

-Gayane: We believed those people. We had never done anything bad to them.

  -Zinaida: After the whole nightmare, about March 15, before we left for
Armenia, when I was coming into the building they were all crying. The
Azerbaijanis were crying, saying, ""Can it be there is no God? How could
they raise their hands against your family? You never did anyone any harm,
you never refused anyone anything, not in hard times, or in time of fortune,
or in time of mourning. How could they give you away? How could they sell you 
down the river?"" They really had given us away. Some of them protected us, but
others gave us away. They sold us down the river.

-Gayane: I was wearing slacks that day, and when it all began I became 
cautious for some reason and I changed my clothes. Azerbaijani women don't 
wear pants. Young Armenian and Russian girls in Sumgait wore pants, but the 
Azerbaijanis found that very strange. And I thought I better put on a skirt, 
otherwise they won't believe me if I told them we were Azerbaijanis. There was
nothing else we could do. No other way out. I was forced to turn myself into 
God knows who. I let my hair down, tousled it, and threw a scarf over my head.

-Zinaida: And she told me, ""Mamma, you hide. Take Diana and go into the other 
room. You two look more like Armenians. They'll figure out that we're 
Armenians right away."" But how could I go away and leave her there?!

-Gayane: I went out onto the balcony. It worked out better that way. We were 
the only Armenian family in the fourth entryway. This gave us hope: we were 
the only ones, the neighbors wouldn't let them in. They, the Azerbaijanis, 
would fear for themselves and for their children. I looked and saw someone 
crawling up on the balcony from below, it was easy to get up onto our balcony.
When we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and 
we would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way. So I turned around
and saw a guy with a knife on our balcony. He looks at me and shouts, ""What 
nationality are you here?""

-Zinaida: At the same time they were knocking on the door.

-Gayane: ""What nationality are you?"" he's shouting. Well at first I was
frightened, but then I got control of myself and answered in perfect 
Azerbaijani, ""You should be ashamed of yourself, asking a question like that.
Can't you see I'm an Azerbaijani? If I were an Armenian would I come out to 
meet you face to face and look you in the eyes?"" He looks at me and tells the
people with him, ""Yes, Azerbaijanis live here."" From below they tell him,
""Check it out, it can't be, they have to be Armenians."" And he asks me again,
""What nationality are you?"" I say, ""Can't you see?"" I started fuming. I could
not say anything else. ""You're blind, that's for sure! You can yell all you
want, but that won't make us Armenians."" I hear them breaking down our
door, and Mamma went toward the door. I say, ""I don't have time to deal
with you, they're breaking down our door."" 1 go to the door and ask, ""Who is
it?"" They answer, ""Open up!"" I say, ""Wait, why are you breaking the door?
What's going on? I'm opening up."" We never locked the lower lock, it was
broken, but now they had locked it out of fear, and I couldn't get it open. I
say wait, I'm looking for the key. I opened the door--it was almost broken
down already. I opened the door and they burst in. I say, ""What's going on?
Why are you breaking down our door?""

-Zinaida: Then they started climbing in from the balcony. They're shouting, 
""Why don't you open the door?"" And I say, ""Well you've already come in the 
balcony."" Then Diana sees their knives, runs into the bathroom, and closes the
door. Gaya cries out, ""Mamma, Diana ran into the bathroom!"" I ran to the door 
and forgot that we were pretending to be Azerbaijanis, and said in Armenian: 
""Diana, open the door!"" Gaya tried to calm them down, and I'm shouting with
tears in my eyes for Diana to open the door.

-Diana I was sitting on the couch with my doll, Little Red Riding Hood. That 
guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle. They 
put it up to Mamma's stomach. I ran to the bathroom, opened the door, and 
slammed it behind me. I was frightened, and started to cry. I shouted, ""Mamma,
they want to kill you!"" And then . . . then they started shouting, ""Give us 
your passports."" And Gaya says, ""What do you need passports for, we're 
Azerbaijanis.""

-Gayane: I tried to convince them that we were Azerbaijanis, I was trying
everything I could, I could get on my knees and plead. I could humble myself, 
because at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my own. To be
honest I didn't care about anything else, as long as my little sister would 
survive, her life and health had cost us so dearly! I tell them, ""What, don't 
you understand anything?"" They started shouting, they were tremendously 
excited, shouting with terribly loud voices, saying that in Stepanakert their 
girls were being killed, raped, and tossed around with pitchforks. Why 
shouldn't they do the same to us? I said, ""Who's doing all that? Who is doing 
it? Some Armenians! What does that have to do with us? Give me the knife, I'll
cut my own face."" ""Now you calm down,"" they tell me.

Zinaida: I told them, ""Why didn't you deal with them there! There, in 
Karabakh? Nothing has happened here, no one has been fighting here, not we 
with the Armenians, nor they with us. Why didn't you give it right back to
them there? What've we got to do with this?"" I got confused. I had been
saying that we were Azerbaijanis, but suddenly I started speaking as though
I were an Armenian, but they didn't notice. One of them was next to me,
with a knife at my breast. And he says to the others, ""What pretty girls."" He
meant Gaya and my 10-year-old Diana. I was terrified. Gaya started assuring 
them that we were Azerbaijanis. One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad 
looks.

-Gayane: He demanded the passports. I said, ""Young man, I don't have my 
passport here."" He says, ""Let's have the passport, we won't believe you
without your passport."" And one of them started hurriedly searching for
documents. They turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down, took the 
picture off the wall, and started pulling the clothes off their hooks, yelling
and shouting, ""Passport! Passport!"" They all started yelling, there was so 
much noise in the apartment. They were all shouting. My hair stood on end. 
Suddenly I said, ""Listen, my Papa died, 40 days haven't passed yet, we have a 
Muslim household, we're in mourning, you should be ashamed of yourselves, 
you've disgraced your honor."" And then Mamma started to cry.

-Zinaida: I started crying: ""My husband died, 40 days haven't yet passed,
aren't you ashamed of yourselves!"" In fact my husband had died seven years
earlier, in 1981. ""We're in mourning, and you burst in here demanding docu-
ments. The documents are at the housing office, I'm filing for my pension.""
Well it seemed like they believed us. Then one guy said, ""They're Lezgins.
Can't you see, there are no men here, only women. Leave."" Another fellow in
the group agreed with him, he also said that we were Lezgins. But a third
said, ""No, they're Armenians."" Well the other two convinced him, I don t know 
how, and all the rest of them listened to them too. There were about 50 of 
them, if not more, all in our three-room apartment, even the entryway was 
filled. They started leaving. Yes, we're Lezgins, we're Lezgins."" They started
leaving, and one of them took our tape recorder with him. And the one who had 
first called us Lezgins says, ""Leave that, what are you doing?"" They seemed to
obey that guy.

-Gayane: He was tall, wearing baggy jeans and a coat.

-Zinaida: With a little moustache, I think.

-Gayane: No, he didn't have a moustache, he was tall with brown hair, he 
wasn't a bad-looking sort. He didn't have anything in his hands.

-Zinaida: He stood at the threshold.

-Gayane: Yes, he didn't look like a bad guy, and you know, his face seemed 
familiar to me. I had seen him somewhere. And more than once. But I can't 
remember where. When he came in I was stupefied, I had a premonition that he 
wouldn't be able to remain indifferent. When he said that we were Lezgins and 
that they should leave, such gladness started to glow inside of me. Hope. They
continued to argue on their way out. Some said, ""They're Armenians all the 
same."" And that fellow answered, ""even if they are Armenians, it's shameful,
the father died, they're mourning, there's nothing but women in the house, 
there's no men. We should stay out of the apartment."" ""What do you mean, stay 
out? We can go in there!"" And he said, ""No, we should stay out, they're 
Lezgins, we're leaving here."" The three of them protected us.

   -Zinaida: No, the two of them. The one in the short coat and the one in the
grey suit, who stood at the threshold, about 19 or 20 years old. Well they
were all young really. The two of them defended us.

-Diana: Three, three!

-Zinaida: Do you remember the third one, Diana?

-Diana: Yes, he was wearing dark clothes.

-Gayane: The third one was the one who came back. He wore a long brown coat.

-Diana: He wore a long, darkish brown coat, and his hair was dark too. When 
they left, they told him downstairs that those women were Armenians, and ran 
back and said that they were going to kill us.

-Zinaida: They had all left, and we had started to calm down a little, and I
closed the door. And then there is a knock. I told Gaya, ""Take Diana and go
into the other room."" My daughters went into the dining room, and I opened the
door. There was a guy there who said, ""Run, hide! They're coming to kill you 
now!"" We ran up to the third floor. We had some good neighbors up there,
Azerbaijanis. I sent the kids and stood there alone, not knowing what to do. 
I was so far gone . . . Out of a whole room I couldn't even think of anything 
to take. I even forgot to take my work documents; at the time I had been 
preparing a report to send to Baku, and the documents were at home. I couldn't
see anything . . . I could only see Vika, my older daughter. I sent Gaya and 
Diana upstairs, and stood there asking that fellow, ""Should I close the door 
and leave everything like this?"" He says, ""What do you mean, door? Get out of 
here, they're coming to kill you! What are you standing there for?"" And I ran 
after the children.

-Gayane: We barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into 
our apartment and started shouting, ""Where are the Armenians?"" We were already
at the neighbors'. They had an infant at the time, and the neighbor said, 
""Don't you worry, I'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what.""

-Zinaida: On the third floor there I started asking the folks, our neighbors,
to go meet Vika. The bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock. I dissolved in
tears, Gaya was soothing me, Diana was next to us, she was crying too, and I'm
already thinking that I've lost my older daughter, but deep in my heart I 
still believe she's alive . . . And my tears choked me. I was going out of my
mind. But no one could leave the building, the courtyard was packed with
people, swarming with them. From the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment 
we were hiding asked the bandits, ""Where are those Armenians, the ones who 
were at home? Where did they make off to?"" They told him they didn't know. 
They asked him where he lived. He answered, ""Can't you see, on the third 
floor."" He asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment. We
heard them taking free reign of our apartment, and they threw our color 
television off the balcony and it exploded.

-Gayane: Mamma was crying the whole time. She fell into a faint and we brought
her around and held her back, because the whole time she kept making for the 
door to go outside, alternately raving and sobbing, shouting, and calling 
Vika. She didn't notice us, probably because we were next to her. Her thoughts
were only on Vika. The neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too, 
offering tea.

-Zinaida: We are very grateful to them. Thanks to them my children and I are
alive, well, and unharmed. When they were throwing our belongings out and 
burning them--the beds, the pillows, and the chairs--our neighbor came to us 
and said, ""How lucky you are that it's not you standing there naked, but some 
other woman instead. You're from our part of the building you lost your 
husband, you have children, thank God you're not in her position, we wouldn't 
have been able to take it. I don't know what I would do."" He of course 
wouldn't have done anything, he was just trying to calm us down. In the yard 
they were torturing our neighbors, fellow Armenians They lived on the fifth 
floor, in the third entryway. A married couple, Vanya and Nina, and their 
three children. Their last name is V. They hid their two daughters, and stayed
with their son to defend themselves, they even got boiling water ready, and an
axe, and held them off for a long time, but the . . . They beat up the 
husband, dragged the wife outside, and stood her naked next to our burning 
things; her husband was lying at her feet on the ground. The crowd shouted, 
""Look at the naked Armenian!"" They were going to throw the poor woman into the
fire. The neighbors came out, an Azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf, and she 
covered herself with it, and the neighbors led her off to their apartment. 
All the neighbors saw and heard it . . .

-Gayane: Mamma wouldn't allow it but I went to the window and saw her standing
there, and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them 
into her body. Our neighbor, who lived in the same entryway as Nina--she 
lives with us in the same boarding house now--saw what they had done, Nina 
showed her, from her knees up, almost up to her neck, her whole body was 
covered, riddled, with wounds.

-Zinaida: In the morning, during the night of the 29th, rather, after one
o'clock, two buses approached the station. I wanted to run out. By then I
didn't care any more if I lived or died, but Gayane wouldn't let me go, and
the neighbors said that I would bring disaster to them and they would be
slain along with their children. Gaya was crying and said that I forgot about
them, my other children, but I could only think of Vika. I imagined her torn
to pieces, I'm a mother, and they're just children, they don't understand I
would have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help. I was
going to do it but Gayane wouldn't let me: ""Mamma, please! Mamma, I beg of 
you!"" The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her cries. So we 
held on that way till morning.

On the morning of the 29th I told our neighbor I was going to go downstairs to
our apartment, maybe Vika was lying there, murdered. He told me he would go 
himself. He was gone for about five minutes, but it seemed like an eternity to
me. He returned and said there was no one there, nothing. I went down too, 
stole down like a mouse, and slipped in everything was thrown all about. I 
didn't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far 
away, farther than the bus station. I began looking for the briefcase with my 
work in it. I was miserable because of my daughter, and at the same time 
because of my work. My documents were there, my travel papers--I worked in the
transport division -- and my trip sheets.

-Gayane: Mamma is a very responsible person, she was always ready to work 
around the clock to do her job.

-Zinaida: I look around and I can't find the briefcase. I didn't care about 
the fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms, that
everything was smashed, and the furniture was broken, I worried about that
later, but at first I was concerned about the lost documents. I went into the
kitchen. My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove: my ring and 
my earrings. It was all there. Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said,
""Mamma, hurry."" And Diana came downstairs too. Gayane found  her coat among 
the debris, and Diana found her track shoes, her coat, and some of her 
dresses.

-Diana: Immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started 
throwing things around in the apartment under us. They threw a television onto
the asphalt, it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap. Then, 
when Vika wasn't there, I wouldn't eat, and they forced me, but I couldn't 
eat. Because I loved Vika terribly and she and I had always gone to the movies
and gone for walks in the park. When we went into our apartment the next day 
and everything was broken, right away I started looking for my dolls and my 
books, but I didn't see anything. When we went back upstairs I managed to take
two cups from my tea service, and Gaya took Vika's suit and one of her own 
dresses. My Italian boots were gone, my brown coat, it was beautiful, there 
wasn't a one of my beautiful dolls, and my giant lion was gone too, the one 
that had been on top of the television. He was very large and very handsome. 
I had two satchels, one for first grade and the other for second grade, one 
was yellow-green with a boy and a girl on it, they're playing a drum and a 
violin, and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears, and on the other 
one were the letters A, B, C, D, E and the numbers 4+5, two girls and a boy 
with their mouths open like they are singing. They were beautiful satchels. 
They were gone too. I had many books, I collected them, they were in the 
bedside tables. And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my 
birthday, they weren't around either. And I had some big books, fat ones, and 
they disappeared, only one was left, The Malachite Box. The Adventures of 
Karlson, Pippi Longstockings, and Fairy Tales of the World were left. All the 
other books were gone.

-Zinaida: I continued searching for my briefcase, and then my supervisor
arrived. He had waited for me until nine o'clock, but I didn't appear, and he
thought something must have happened, so he came. He's a Russian, Aleksei 
Semyonovich Lomakin. Alik Aliyev, the mechanic, came with him. When they saw 
my wrecked apartment they were just petrified, they could not say a thing. 
When I saw them I started crying. My Azerbaijani neighbors came in. Some of 
them were crying, others were helping me pick up. I go on looking for my 
documents and at the same time put things into the wardrobe. Now that I 
remember it it's both funny and painful: How could I have thought that I had 
returned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal? 
Incidentally, later, when I went back to the apartment again those things were
gone too. And the door was gone. After my supervisor left, in the afternoon, 
the neighbor said that we should leave, find another refuge. ""I'm afraid,"" he 
said, ""that someone saw you come to my apartment, and that they could kill you
and us too. My God, where could I go it was daytime and those . . . I don't 
even know what to call them, the bandits, those marauders, those jackals, I 
don't know what to call them, I can't find the words, they were everywhere. 
Where should I go with two girls? When I opened the door I had tears in my 
eyes, and I was terrified . . . And he said, ""Go to Alik's, he's an
Azerbaijani, too."" and I say, ""You should have said that earlier, when my 
supervisor was here with the car, he could have taken us with him."" Everyone 
feared for their own lives. What could I do? I went out into the entryway and 
stood. And he says, ""any other time I would keep you here a year, or two. But 
right now, I'm sorry . . . "" Then another door opened, also on the third 
floor. I ask the neighbor, ""Tayara, can we hide at your place?"" She's an 
Azerbaijani too. She says, ""What kind of question is that? Come in!"" She hid 
us. There were many people in the courtyard, and Gaya and I hid in the 
wardrobe, and they put Diana under a mattress, leaving a small opening so the 
child could breathe. Tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us 
out, and when they came back she would hide us again.

We sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour. Gaya became ill, and I allowed 
her to get out. My legs fell asleep and felt like cannons. We hadn't eaten or 
drunk anything for so long, since the 27th, when we saw that horror--and all 
of it just snapped in me. Tayara's husband went outside, even though I begged 
him to stay, saying there should be a man in the house. He said that he'd be 
in the courtyard, and if anything happened his wife would signal him. She put 
her passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came 
in she could show them that they were an Azerbaijani family. My girls went to 
the window--and what was going on out there! I feared for my children, that 
someone would recognize them from the street. Gaya let her hair down and put 
on a scarf so she would resemble an Azerbaijani, but directly across there was
a 9-story building, their windows were right across from us, and I shouted 
that someone would see her and give us away on the spot. But she kept on 
looking.

-Diana: I watched too.

-Zinaida: Downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers. The soldiers
didn't shoot, they didn't have orders to. I saw them throwing rocks at
the soldiers, they were young boys, 18- and 19-year olds, and they defended
themselves . . . I'm a mother after all, and they were no different from my
children. When one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding I had to
stop looking, l couldn't watch anymore . . . I imagined my children in their
shoes . . .

-Gayane: The troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned 
off the buildings, and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station, Block 
36, and our Microdistrict 3. But they only cordoned them off from the outside.
The mob fell upon the soldiers, who started to protect themselves, and the mob
surged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it. They caught several 
Azerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs. One fell down and they
cracked open another's head . . .

-Zinaida: They show Lebanon on television, and the war in Afghanistan--that's just
what it was like. Like in America, how they attack demonstrations with shields
and clubs--that's just how it was in our courtyard.

-Gayane: Don't compare it with America, those were peaceful demonstrations, 
but these?!

-Zinaida: But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America! They 
attacked the soldiers, hurled stones at them . . . Then I thought, where's the
tear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators? If they had used 
gas on those jackals they all would have scattered.

-Gayane: They would not have scattered. The soldiers had been there since 
morning, they didn't bring in fresh troops. They hadn't eaten, they were fine 
standing there for about three hours, but then they got tired. They weren't 
even allowed to sit down . . . At noon they, the soldiers, attacked them, and 
then the tables were turned. The mob went after the soldiers, the guys were 
bunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their 
shields, and the Azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them.
And those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields. And meanwhile
tanks with machine guns were cruising the streets . . . They always say, ""Our 
children have never seen war."" I never even dreamed about it, there was no 
need to. But then I thought about those people who had lived through a war. It
was truly horrible . . . The guys were tired, exhausted, some had had their 
clubs taken away, others, their shields, they had been beaten, they were 
covered in blood . . . so many died! They beat the soldiers with their own 
clubs and shields. And those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves, 
they couldn't open fire. They couldn't even defend themselves, let alone us. 
It's comical . . .

-Zinaida: What are you saying? How can it be funny?

-Gayane: No, I didn't mean that: How could something like that happen during 
our Soviet period? It's painfully embarrassing! And they burned the armored 
personnel carriers, too. Someone shouted, ""Get away, it's going to blow!"" 
Everyone scattered away, and the armored personnel carrier exploded. The 
soldiers lost their senses. And when they drove the personnel carrier and the 
bus at the mob out of rage and fury, they drove right up on the sidewalk.

-Zinaida: The bus that had brought the troops. Only the driver was in it. The 
bus ran over three people straight off, I saw it. And two armored personnel 
carriers ran over four more. All in one or two minutes. The bus ran over 
three, one of the carriers ran over two, and the second, two more. Right on 
our street there's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places; one 
of the armored personnel carriers went that way, and they say it ran over
several over there, too. But they ran over seven before our eyes. Then the bus
ploughed into a book kiosk.

-Gayane: No, that was a flower place. It was a new booth. He drove straight 
into it.

-Zinaida: The driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the
middle of the road and set it on fire.

-Gayane: And I also saw the troops put a bunch of Azerbaijanis in a bus and 
take them in a convoy to Baku. There were many arrests.

-Zinaida: Our neighbor, the one who hid us, couldn't take it, and he told his 
wife that we should leave. They were running around in the courtyard looking 
for the Armenians. They knew that they were hiding with Azerbaijanis, and they
were saying that they were going to check the Azerbaijani families. Poor 
Tayara got scared too, and started to cry; I pleaded with her, I said that I 
would remember forever how she saved my children and me, but where could we 
go?

-Gayane: She didn't make us leave, she said that she would do anything, but 
she was afraid.

-Zinaida: I told Tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at
night we would return to our apartment. Then her husband came back and said 
that a curfew had been imposed. He says, ""Zina, you owe us a drink. Gorbachev 
announced a curfew."" And Bagirov [First Secretary of the Communist Party of 
Azerbaijan SSR] was on television, he said that two people had been killed in 
Karabagh, but nothing was wrong, automobile windows had been broken, but there
hadn't been any killings. He kept making statements, and there were 
Azerbaijani songs and dances. Tayara turned the TV all the way up. When we 
learned of the curfew we calmed down, but then a crowd ran into the courtyard 
again, a large one. Our neighbor told them that there had been only one 
Armenian family here, but they had already killed them all, there was no one 
left. We hid in the wardrobe again. and they stuck Diana back under the bed.

-Gayane: Tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there, and
found two bandits. They asked her, ""What are you doing here"" Tayara answered, 
""I came to take something for myself."" ""Take all you want, they're gone now."" 

-Zinaida: Yes, she had wanted to get something for us, at least some bedding. 
She said, ""What are you going to do, empty handed, naked, with three children,
nothing remains of your entire apartment."" In short, we calmed down, and the 
crowd raced off to the other building, the one across from us. I don't know 
what went on there.

-Gayane: The curfew had its effect on the gangs, many started to disperse:
they were warned that they would open fire on them. The soldiers didn't know 
the city, they couldn't get oriented, they drove up and down the main streets,
but didn't go into the courtyards. When we were at the City Party Committee 
they asked people from Sumgait to go with them and show them the way.

-Zinaida: The tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th.

-Gayane: No, Mamma, the tanks had been there earlier, but were near the City 
Party Committee, where the Armenians were . . . After midnight, on March 1, 
when I had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights, Mamma said, 
""Get your things together, they have sent buses for us."" As it was we had been
dressed the entire time. Mamma went to check it out . . .and came back for us.

-Zinaida: When I came back for the children Tayara said that Vika was alive 
and well, some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe 
place. I both believed it and didn't believe it. We ran out to the tanks. The 
Gambarians were there, Roman and Sasha; their father, Shurik, the clarinetist,
was killed, and their mother was there. Sasha came over and asked about the 
girls. I was surprised, how did he know my girls? He said that he knew me and 
the girls. Our neighbor himself went for Gaya and Diana and it seemed like he 
was taking forever so I went after him. Another neighbor came out, Anna 
Vasilyevna, a Russian: ""Zinochka, my dear, goodbye and good luck."" She kissed 
Diana. They put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be 
taken to the City Party Committee. The bus wouldn't start, so they put us on 
another one. It was pouring rain.

-Diana: When they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets, 
and they all had clubs and shields. And when the Azerbaijanis attacked them, 
many of the soldiers died. They threw paving stones--huge rocks--at the 
soldiers. I saw this myself. The soldiers ran over those Azerbaijanis with the
tanks. The soldiers saw that the Azerbaijanis were doing violence to people 
and they ran over them out of rage. We got scared and they hid me under a 
mattress and a blanket, and Gaya and Mamma crawled into the wardrobe. And they
were fighting right down there on the street . . . Near the building they were
blowing up buses and tanks, and cars were burning, and there were many dead in
the courtyard. They drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a 
street, they just drove, and the ones who didn't manage to get out of the way 
were run over by the tanks. And when we left--it was evening, it was already 
dark--there were three buses, and one of them had soldiers in it. Mamma ran up
and said, ""Get your clothes on, let's go."" Gaya was wearing slippers, and I 
had on my blue dress, but it was an old one. I was wearing my old jacket, my 
old dress, and slippers. And nothing else. Gaya had on a skirt, her Angora 
sweater, and slippers. It was raining hard, and there were puddles on the 
street. They gave Mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short-sleeved 
dress; she put it on and we ran out. We got onto the bus and I was hungry, one
of the soldiers from Yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to
the other in his arms. I gave him the little glass that remained from Vika's
trousseau, and he gave me his telephone number.

-Gayane: In the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window.
We had to be ready for anything. They took us to the City Party Committee, let
us out, and then took us into the City Party Committee building under armed 
guard. It was jammed with people and you couldn't breathe. We asked, ""Are 
these all us? Armenians?"" They answered yes. We were surprised that there were
so many Armenians in Sumgait. All those years we lived there and didn't know 
there were so many Armenians, 18,000. We were struck by that, we had never 
noticed. Going downstairs the next day I ran into the Secretary of the 
Komsomol from Vika's plant, the Khimprom. He said that Vika was alive and 
well. When I told Mamma she of course calmed down some more. But you know, 
after all that it was hard to believe anything, our faith in everything was 
just gone. She didn't believe it completely.

-Zinaida: I didn't believe it because I had heard all kinds of things. When
we arrived at the City Party Committee we heard everything imaginable! It
was the fear of God. I saw many of our acquaintances, they were kissing each 
other and asking how their children and homes were. Many people already knew 
that there had been a pogrom of our apartment. They had seen the broken 
windows. I cried, saying that I didn't know where Vika was. One woman said 
that they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn't find one of 
them; the other had been slashed all over. A second said that her husband and
her son had been murdered. That was Nelli Aramian. She lived in Building 6 in 
our microdistrict. They killed her husband, Armo, and her son Artur. I heard 
so many things like that that I was already starting to lose touch; my 
patience had run dry waiting for my daughter. Later an Azerbaijani fellow came
to me and said, Aunt Zina, Vika sent me, she's alive and well and hidden in a 
safe place; if you want I'll call her there and you can speak with her. We 
went downstairs to the first floor and he called Vika. I spoke with her, heard
the voice of my child. She had managed to survive in that hell. Then I started
begging that Azerbaijani to bring her to the City Party Committee. He tried to
talk me out of it: ""I'll bring her wherever you go, don't worry, I've looked 
after her better than a brother does a sister."" All the same I asked him to 
get her. He brought her and I calmed down. On the second day there was a 
meeting with Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of the USSR,] and people started shouting. One shouted, ""Give 
me my son back!"", another yelled, ""Where is my daughter?!"", a third wanted her
husband . . . Bagirov  was there too, and he stood there blinking, not saying 
anything.

-Gayane: When Demichev asked where we wanted to go, everyone shouted, ""To
Russia!"" To be honest we were all frightened of Armenia, there were such wild 
rumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream, and no one wanted to go 
to Armenia. But he said that he couldn't evacuate 18,000 people to Russia and 
that he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with 
them. And he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our 
apartments. On March 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of 
Nasosny. We were taken care of marvelously by the military. They sent special 
flights of children right from there to Minvody, Yerevan, and Moscow. One 
woman left for Moscow with a letter for Gorbachev and Gromyko.

-Zinaida: The worst was truly behind us by then. Everything had passed, but 
the pain will remain for our whole lives. It cannot be forgotten. Under no 
circumstances should we, our children, or our grandchildren forget. Who will
answer for those who died? For our mothers, sisters, brother, sons and
daughters? Who will bear the responsibility? Who will wash away their blood? 
Someone should be made to answer, and severely, so it has an effect on the 
people that did with us as they pleased . . . It isn't over yet, now we live 
here, in Armenia, protected, but the issue isn't resolved. We would like
to stay in Armenia, in our homeland, so that all the Armenian people will be
united. Then we will be invincible. Armenians won't be scattered throughout 
the Soviet Union, about the world, and if we're all together this won't happen
again. As a mother of three children, as a woman, as a sister, I ask Armenians
to be united so that what happened in Sumgait will never happen again. Our 
homeland . . . The only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an 
apartment and getting jobs. So that our children can work for the good of 
Armenia. If we aren't able to, then let our children do it. And if it's 
possible, we'll work for the good of Armenia too. This is the land of our 
forefathers. Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers lived here too, it was 
only later that people dispersed all over. Like a mother, the land here bore 
and reared us. It is our wife, and will protect us, too. I want but one thing:
that our people never see the hardship that our children saw, that your 
children here, in Armenia, never see anything like it.

I couldn't agree more.  Canada has an anti-hate law which exists to punish
those who wilfully spread false propaganda (lies) for the purpose of 
putting down another group.  This is actually the law that David Irving
will hopefully be found guilty under due to his denial of the Holocaust.
It's too bad that this useless ""Centre for Policy Research"" isn't in Canada.
It'd set a nice precedent to how the law applies in Cyberspace.

"+ I am looking at a new LC III and a used IIci.  Prices

+ The IIci has much greater potential for expansion, a la NuBus and
+ greater memory capacity.

How important is this? How many NuBus cards do you have/plan to
acquire? How much memory do you really need? I've got a ci, and
20mb of ram. That's plenty. I also have a 24bit graphics card
on the NuBus - I'm a sucker for pretty pictures...I think the
LCIII can have a bootable ramdisk in memory, which a ci can
not have. At least, not out of the box.

+ The LC III would be new, under warranty, newer ROMs (is the IIci
+ ""32-bit clean""?), and would have sound input.  I also like the
+ ""pizza-box"" case.

The ci is 32-bit clean. I solved the sound input problem with
a MacRecorder. But that's gotten to be a fairly expensive
solution now that Macromind owns MacRecorder.

+ Performance-wise, I have read that they are almost identical, the
+ LC III being a little slower.

The actual difference is probably not worth worrying over.
 
+ So, which should I get?

Depends on the price you can get the ci for. Educationally speaking,
the 4/80 [?] LCIII here at FSU can be had at just under $1300. Add
in roughly $500 for a monitor. Last I'd heard, an 8mb LCIII simm
went for ~$250.

Actually, I find the stuff about JC being a carpenter more
interesting.  Is there an independent source for this assertion,
or is it all from the Christian Bible?  Is there any record at
all of anything he built?  A table, a house, some stairs (Norm
Abrams says the real test of a carpenter's skill is building
stairs with hand tools).  Did he leave any plans behind for, say
kitchen counters and cabinets?  Did he build his own cross?
If so, did he use pressure-treated lumber?  Gotta use that
pressure-treated anywhere that wood meets concrete, but it
holds up better anyway for mose outdoor applications.  I keep
seeing these bumper-stickers that say ""My boss is a Jewish
Carpenter,"" but they're always on the back of Ford Escorts,
and a real carpenter's apprentice would probably drive a
pickup, so I'm out for verification that he really was a
carpenter.

Not useful unless you've got some truly wonderful propulsion system for
the mother ship that can't be applied to the probes.  Otherwise it's
better to simply launch the probes independently.  The outer planets
are scattered widely across a two-dimensional solar system, and going
to one is seldom helpful in going to the next one.  Uranus is *not* on
the way to Neptune.  Don't judge interplanetary trajectories in general
by what the Voyagers did:  they exploited a lineup that occurs only
every couple of centuries, and even so Voyager 2 took a rather indirect
route to Neptune.

 The SUNDAY TIMES 8 March 1992
 Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war
 -------------------------------------------
 Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in
 the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, reports from
 Agdam
 ------
 Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt
 roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier
 times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off
 the map.
 .......
 As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of
 Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt
 that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been
 the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke
 apart.
 .......
 I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and
 people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,
 a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the
 town, called her community ""sitting ducks, ready to get shot"". She and
 her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.
 .......
 ""The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and
 the government does nothing."" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,
 said. ""Next they will drive us out or kill us all,"" said Dilbar, his
 wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in
 the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.
 ......
 ""It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.
 There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then
 all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had
 just entered their trap.""
 The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian
 forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in
 the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying
 as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading
 towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge
 from the Armenians.
 ""The Armenians just shot and shot and shot,"" said Omar Veyselov, lying
 in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. ""I saw my wife and
 daughter fall right by me.""
 People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the
 loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: "" Where is my
 daughter, where is my son ?"" wailed a mother. ""Raped. Butchered. Lost.""
 Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they
 tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians
 were caught in ""crossfire"".

Radiating from someone who is incapable of providing a single scholarly
source on his 'genocide apology program', it is rather amusing. Again,
where is your non-existent list of scholars and scholarly sources?
Here is mine:

""An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the
 systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of 
 the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at 
 least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The 
 memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and 
 eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in
 1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound.""
     (Rachel A. Bortnick - The Jewish Times - June 21, 1990)


 ""In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul.
  It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us
  create for ourselves. It certainly is possible to severe the artificial
  life-support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us
  falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats 
  in this alien land.""
            (Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - ""Preserving the Armenian purity"") 


 ""The crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination 
  of the Muslim population in Soviet Republic of Armenia, Karabag, 
  Bosnia and Herzegovina is an 'Islamic Holocaust' comparable to the 
  extermination of 2.5 million Muslims by the Armenian Government 
  during the WWI and of over 6 million European Jews during the WWII.""
                  (Tovfik Kasimov - Azeri Leader - September 25, 1992)
                 

 ""Today's ethnic cleansing policies by the Serbian dictatorship against
  Croatians and Muslims of Yugoslavia, as well as the Soviet Republic
  of Armenia's against the Muslim population of neighboring Azerbaijan,
  are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide 
  perpetrated by the Armenian Government 78 years ago against the
  Turkish and Kurdish Muslims and Sephardic Jews living in these
  lands.""         (Cebbar Leygara - Kurdish Leader - October 13, 1992)

"So what's the deal with the PDS slot in the IIsi?

I recently purchased a Mac IIsi.  I want to add a non-Apple monitor to the
system.  I was told that you could buy a 90 degree angled PDS to NuBus adaptor
card so you can fit a standard NuBus card into the computer.

Am I mistaken or do have to buy a PDS monitor card specifically for the IIsi?
I've seen the PDS monitor cards for the si, but they seem expensive, and I'm
not exactly made of money.

Any ideas?  Help.  Clue me in!

Actually, both numbers are correct.  The difference is in the direction
of the acceleration.  For pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse to
the direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, the
acceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance).  In this
case, you can only put up with about 8 g's even with a pressure suit.  

The record for acceleration, though, is measured along ""the direction
you're facing"" (for lack of a better term).  As I recall, this record
was set in rocket sleds back in the 60's -- and was about 40 g's or so.",3

Who asked the original questions, and why was it so _broad_.
Are we talking pure processing power (what kind of processing BTW)

Or are we shopping for a home computer based on the CPU specs (yuck)!

I just finished a project that involves real-time processing of serial
data and discovered that the programming interface (assembly) has
_a lot_ to do with the ""power"" of a CPU in a particular application.
If what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given,
then not only is it easy, but it's cheap and quick.  If you have to
fake things (like resolving indirection without a LEA instruction), then
your cycle count goes through the roof!

well, let's _NOT_ start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose.

The main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the
primary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image
processing software that much faster. When they use the _same_ deconvolution 
software on the images from the fixed Hubble, be ready for some 
incredible results!  There is every reason to believe that the results will 
_exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin.  

Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software.  It works 
realtime, not after the fact, as is the case with Hubble.  You might be
interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market, in
the form of the AO-2 Adaptive Optics System.  Starting on page 52 of the 
April, 1993 Sky & Telescope is a three page review of this new product.
It lists for $1,290.  The article states: ""The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System 
comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry 
around.""  Even though this device is really only good for the brightest
objects, ""it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter
in the telescope's focal plane.""  Now just imagine how well this infant 
technology will do in a few years, especially in a dedicated system that 
has hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many man-hours invested in its
development.

This is a whole different situation.  If aliens were able to get here prior
to us being able to get there, one might conclude that they would be more advanced
and therefore ""more intelegent"" that we are.  However if we get somewhere where there
is life, chances are we wont be able to communicate with them.  So we will have
no clue as to weather they are ""intelegent"" or not.


That's a good point, I hadn't thought of it that way.  My question however was
more along the lines of... Every year the US spends millions of tax dollars
and giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign
countries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night.
Would we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn't resolved
these issues on our own?


But... Your comment brings up another good question.  Over the years we have decided
that certain cultures need improvements.  The native americans is a good example.  Prior
to our attempt to civilize them, the native american culture had very little crime, no
homelessnes, no poverty.  Then the europeans came along and now they have those and
more.  If we encounter life elsewhere, do we tell them they have to live in houses, farm
the land and go to church on sunday?

My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means ""slow down"".

Seriously, concentrate on being very smooth, and you will make her
experience much more enjoyable.  Even a normal upshift causes your
passenger to bob, so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the
clutch to eliminate this.  It's more work, but your passenger will
appreciate it!  Also, I've found that using more rear brake than normal
helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops, which
makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on.  If you're going
sport riding, have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves
against the tank so you don't have to bear both your weights with your
arms.  (Again your bike will dive less too)

So you stand by the statement that all Armenians are barbarians.  OK, I see.

make GENOCIDE possible.  But I guess (and this is where Serdar will fill the

Don't you find it weak that all of Serdars enemies are  
Fascist/NAZI/barbarian/_________fill in the blank with any catch all bad term.


Public knowlege?  I was not aware of that.  NOW I see, the ARMENIANS decide to  
kill the Israeli athletes in 1972 as PRACTICE.  I was confused, but thanks for  
clearing that up.

Wow, you are on a roll with the accusations today Serdar, so how did the  
Armenians steal from the Turkish children?  Was it their lunch money?  This is  
very cute how you inserted children in this fill in the blank accusation sheet  
you fill out every day.  It really touches my heart.  Oh and thank you for  
letting me know that Kurds and Armenians hate each other.  I was not aware of  
this.  The only time I have ever talked about Kurds it was about the WONDERFUL  
treatment they were recieving in Turkey.  They must have a high incedence of  
insanity because there sure are a lot of them fighting against the  
non-oppresive Turkish government that has let their culture flower over the  
past 70 years.


Thanks for the unbiased TURKISH MEDIA SOURCE.  I am sure the Milliyet is rated

Being related to former trainers, I have come to know that humans do have all the
advantages (well, at least one anyway). It is a little known fact that a dog will
involuntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow. I
was told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and
force it down the dog's throat. The dog would naturally gag and release, and become
momentarily disoriented. This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and
have our throats examined ( Proof Positive ). In the time during the dog's
disorientation, the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a 
choke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into
unconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). Finally, run like
the wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really
pissed.

"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>
Subject: Rabin and his Palestinians kapos


Rabin's plans for a Palestinian police

(from The Other Front, Alternative Information Center,
Jerusalem, 5 May 1993)

""The decision to view the setting up of a local police force 
for (sic) the Palestinians as the central issue for 
deliberation at the peace talks to be resumed next week - 
even before subjects like elections in the territories and 
areas of juridiction in the framework of autonomy - is a 
sign of the Israeli government's serious attitude towards 
the peace process.

""The setting up of a police force is not part of the 'gesture 
package', but deals with the very heart and substance of 
the Palestinian struggle for national identity. As it turns 
out, the main objective guiding the prime minister in the 
setting up of a Palestinian police force - and apparently 
also supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres - is to 
ensure the holding of democratic elections in the 
territories.""

Thus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial (Israeli daily 
Hadashot, 23 April), and his position articulates the 
thinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this 
issue in the past two weeks. Over against them stand the 
settlers and rightwing parties, who also interpret the 
decision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian 
police force as a significant step towards the instituting of 
real autonomy, something which will restrict what can be 
done by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. With a variety of demonstrations, including street 
theater on 'What will happen when there is a Palestinian 
police force', rightwing elements are attempting to 
frighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go 
back on his decision. Members of the Kach movement 
have even begun to organize a 'settler police force' in the 
Occupied Territories, as counter-balance to the future 
Palestinian police force.

However, as Barzilai points out, the main function of the 
new police force - as far as the Israeli government is 
concerned - has nothing to do with the settlers, over 
whom they will apparently have no authority, but will 
control political groups within the Palestinian population, 
whom the government is interested in neutralizing. 
Writes Barzilai:

""...According to ideas currently taking shape, the setting 
up of a local police force in the territories will precede, 
not only the stage of electsion, but also the final stages of 
the preparing of the interim autonomy agreement.

""The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a 
local Palestinian police force is evidence that the 
government is serious about arriving at a settlement with 
the Palestinians...""

It's no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly 
worried about this new Israeli initiative. And it is 
inevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal 
Husseini and the rest of the delegation members, from a 
variety of directions, to refuse the gift which Rabin would 
like to give them. But at this stage, it looks like the 
Palestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his 
plans.

Saudi Arabia is an oppressive regime that has been recently interfering

I would recomend to anyone out there to visit your local Christian bookstore
and become aware of the stuff they sell.	Quite
interesting.  Most of the stuff is far from intelectual.  (About the level of
Chick pamphelets...)  If it is a common fundie bookstore, it should have at
least one section about how you should hate Wiccans, Pagans, Catholics,
Mormons, rock musicians, and anyone else who is not as fanatical as them. 
(Hate for the ""Love of God(tm)""!) It is even more interesting watching the
people who frequent such places.  Very scary people.  They hear voices from
""God"" telling them whatever they want to hear.  (If they were not Christians,
most of them would be locked away.  Maybe this is why Federal money was
reduced to Mental institutions by the reagan administration...	Had to get
their religious leaders out...)

Would Mr. Hart please explain how one could get every nation on
earth and every corporation to agree that astronomers own the
night sky without `coercion'.   Remember that not every nation
follows the English common law.   In most countries, for most of
history, it was probably true that the rulers `owned' everything
not explicitly owned by individuals.   Even in North America,
where by the principle enunciated, the aboriginal inhabitants should
have owned everything, when new arrivals wanted to use land
and resources, they just took it over.  In case Mr. Hart hasn't noticed,
there is currently a brutal war going on in Bosnia about who owns what.
Of course, if some friendly super power were to give an international
astronomy organization some anti-satelite missiles and also agree
to defend it if attacked, such a proposal might work, but it
would hardly be non-coercive.

Some of us nutty environmentalists think it might make sense first
to try to mobilize public opinion against advertising in space
and also to use governmental actions (like taxing power, for example)
to discourage them.   This of course would be too coercive for
Mr. Hart.",3

Infact on tuesday, the Bosnian foreign minister asked formally the UN to leave Bosnia,
just to show how much hypocracy is there in Europe. These so called UN is actually
helping Serbs carry out their etnic-clensing/murders/rapes. In Zepa the UN effectively
helped the Serbs carry out their heinous crimes by spreading conflicting reports that
nothing was going on there. The cowards, or so called UN peacemakers, only ""attempted"" to 
go out there for a fact finding mission -as if with all the ham-radio operators were lying
and all the US war planes out there have no means of flying over there. This is the biggest
farce in the history of the world and the same act has been repeated over and over again in
different beseiged Bosnian towns....

Yes! I heard today that the president of Bosnia- under pressure from the ""civilized nations""
has appealed to the UN to stay there in Bosnia. He should know better..

These hypocrates (Sadly! it includes Clinton administration too) all came out and said
that the call for a referendum from bosnian serbian perliment (or a bunch of
rapists/criminals) is a farce and yet they have to wait for the result of this referendum
to act....

Apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger isn't as strong 
as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger.  Hurt
found that a surprising number of accident-involved motorcyclists hadn't
used their brakes at all prior to impact.  

I think the only way you'll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in 
a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you
ever use, and to practice it constantly, even when you have no need to do
any turning.  If you follow me down a long straight, and I seem to be 
wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need, it's because
I'm practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in
my path.  All of this practice may indeed be futile, but if I have even
milliseconds to react, the most *familiar* tactic available (and hopefully 
the most automatic) will be countersteering.  The same logic applies to braking
with the front brake, of course.",2

An obvious effect of homosexuality is non-procreation.  That, unlike your

beliefs.  I defend homosexuality because (a) what people do with their
bodies is none of my business (b) I defend the equal rights of
all humans.  Do you?

Prove your statement.  Electrons are waves.  Electrons are particles.  I

don't exist.



First of all, your earlier statements have absolutely nothing to do
with your question.  Why did you post them?  To show that athiests,

"I think there are some generally accepted criteria according to which
one can evaluate whether certain policies or practices constitute
racial discrimination. These criteria are to be found for example in the
1.  International Convention for Abolition of All Forms of Racial
    Discrimination (ratified by most countries)
2.   The International Covenant of Political and Civil Rights
3.   The Human Rights Charter
4.   The European Convention of Human Rights

If one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these
legally binding instruments, and does not resort to sophistry, it is
obvious that the State of Israel is guilty of racial discrimination.


The people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion
by the Zionist regime are the Palestinian refugees, some of whom live
under Israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora.

They are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole
reason that they are not Jews. International law does not include any
provisions which permits such denial of rights, under any circumstance.
Israel's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. By allowing
the return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in Tel in any area  of
the State of Israel, the State would finally gain its legitimaty under
international law and could be justified in asking to be recognized. It
would facilitate the peaceful integration of Israel into the Middle-east
and constitute the best guarantee for permanent Jewish presence -
in the area. Any attempt to create a separation, formal and human, between the
Israeli Jewish and Palestinian Arab communities, is fraught with
genociadal implications. I hope that U.S. Jews, who sincerely wish that
peace prevail in Israel/Palestine, will finally realize this fact.

Here you descend into total inanity. Your inability to distinguish
between 'the cold-blooded genocide of Muslim people by the Armenians' 
and 'the Armenian war' is incredible. Now, please provide us with your 
corrections.

Source: Stanford J. Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russian
armies in 1914, ""History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume
II: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975).""
(London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316.

""In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city 
 of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, 
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan 
 on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized 
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during 
 the next two days.""

""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves.""

""With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
 World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.""

""...Meanwhile, Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final
 plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the 
 president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response:

 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the 
  glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian
  arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the
  Bosporus. Let, with Your will, great Majesty, the peoples remaining
  under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey
  who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new
  free life under the protection of Russia.'[155]

Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies. Preparations were made
to strike the Ottomans from the rear, and the czar returned to St. Petersburg
confident that the day finally had come for him to reach Istanbul.""

""An Armenian state was organized at Van under Russian protection, and it 
 appeared that with the Muslim natives dead or driven away, it might be
 able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient Armenian
 civilization. An Armenian legion was organized 'to expel the Turks from
 the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted
 Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet.'[162] Thousands of Armenians from
 Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new 
 Armenian state...By mid-July there were as many as 250,000 Armenians
 crowded into the Van area, which before the crisis had housed and fed
 no more than 50,000 people, Muslim and non-Muslim alike.[163]""

I went through this just a few weeks ago; here it comes again. The 
entire Turkish population of Armenia (which Armenians called Tartars) 
constituted at least about 40% of the total population of Armenia 
was deliberately exterminated. (For the population statistics, please 
look to the book of Richard Hovannessian, ""Armenia on the Road to 
Independence."") I listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime 
by the writings of one Armenian, one American, and one British. They 
are: ""Men Are Like That"" by Leonard R. Hartill; ""Adventures in the Near 
East"" by A. Rawlinson; ""World Alive, A Personal Story"" by Robert Dunn. 
Also, I personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings 
of two Armenians and also one American. The official British report about 
this massacre mentioned in one of these documents (Lord Curzon-Aharonin 
interview) is the report of the British High Commissioner to Caucasia, 
Sir Oliver Wardrop.


""An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the
 systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of 
 the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at 
 least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The 
 memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and 
 eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in
 1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound.""

"We are having a problem with a Quadra 950 that has stumped a couple of
techs sent to us by the vendor, as well as us :-)
This Quadra is 'stuffed' with 64Mb RAM, 2Mb VRAM and some large disk (400Mb
I think). What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time
the video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the
Mac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video
circuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications,
even pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it's
pretty hard to hit menu items ;-)
We had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem
has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has
varied. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the
cache was turned OFF (yes OFF).  This is the only symptom that is not
obviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU
right?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did
not keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have
has this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it,
but did it twice within an hour yesterday).
The technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty
sharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had
previously tried ourselves anyway). These included:
-swapping the RAM
-swapping the VRAM
-swapping monitors (3 different 13"" Apple RGB and 2 16"" Apple RGB)
-swapping cables
-disconnecting HD and booting from floppy
-sacrificing various small mammals
Here are some other facts:
-when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed
 (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out)
-the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards
 that exhibit it in our lab
-Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards
 that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as
 faulty according to us.
Here are some speculations:
-I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that
 much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do
 with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can
 reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring).
-the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls' - claims that our
 walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac's operation. We
 have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it's not in
 the exact same spot....) Please don't tell me this is probably it, I do
 not want to believe it.
-it's probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past
 security at the entrance to our site.

Has anyone any ideas? Please? Please email as well as posting cause I seem
to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less

entire time on interstates, which would be a total waste of time, that's
at least 8 hours on the road every day not including eating/peeing/
sight-seeing etc.

I was contemplating a similar trip, but from Ottawa to LA, or
maybe Ottawa to Austin Tx.  

I figured if I wanna do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it, I'd
have to get my ass off the major Interstates and spend LOTS of
time enjoying the country around me; i.e. stopping with a camera,
meeting towns-people, going to a few bars.  No sense spending 2 weeks
looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas
pump.

I estimated I'd need at least 4-5 weeks to make the trip worthwhile.


In question 8:)


Try and stay off the interstates!!!


Depending on your route and my plans, I may be heading that way as far
as at least Detroit.

I believe that Apple, Sun and a number of other desktop machine
manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate
power-saving techniques;  this is also something that governments in
other countries are likely to require in the future, so expect to see
it.  This may include the ability for the system to fully power down
the monitor, via a controllable power outlet, and power it back on
automatically.  (Is this a ""sell"" on screen saver software companies?)

Goals for ""idle"" power consumption have been set at something like 30
watts for the system, not including the monitor (? don't quote me on
this).

Note that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial,
especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems.
Sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for
the night would save the company (Sun itself) on the order of $1M per
year.  Putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in would
probably have greater than double that value.

Given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and
home computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...),
building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to
cut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data I heard.",1

That's fascinating.  I take it that you're expressing skepticism
at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced
the Constitution of the people who stole their continent.  You
could be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there any
reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Here's some more:

   Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not
   only invited to participate in the deliberations of our ""founding
   fathers,"" but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy
   arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany
   Plan of Union, and later the Articles of Confederation and the
   Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts,
   and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion
   Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express
   a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were
   revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the
   American psyche.
   ...
      By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the
   Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited
   forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors
   on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged
   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at
   Albany Congress: ""It would be a strange thing...if six nations
   of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union
   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted
   for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should
   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies.""
      According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs
   and congressional delegates in order to ""hammer out a plan that he
   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy.""

Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of California
at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the
American Nation_ addresses this issue.",0

re:  Cecil King's Nominating Statement 

Dear Chick:
      We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the 
MOA this year.  Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in the
Owners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by
the by-laws.  In pertinent part, the rules state:

""Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to
a combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.

    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil's
statement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with
the word ""undertiding"" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement
of his Position Statement.  As a result, Cecil has obtained what I view as a
grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president.  This does
not just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the 
process.  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps
you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election.
     Parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, I would
be most appreciative that when tou call me an ""asshole"" you remind the
letter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost
guaranteed to have woeful consequences.
   With kind regards, I remain,

As many posters have said in as many posts lately, this is just
not true.  For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no
faith at all.  You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the 
_possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render 
that possibilty of no interest.  It is a very different thing to say
that you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't
have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to 
think about.  It's not either or.  Sometimes is just something else
more interesting that occupies your mind.  

I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable, but not necessarily
applied to god and religion.  It takes both faith and dogma to
expect the sun to come up every morning, but there is overwhelming
reason every single day, day in and day out, for _everyone_ to put 
his faith and dogma there.  Not so with the christian religion.

[ This would make me a bit suspect of Mr. Ramsey's qualifications
as a self-styled ""expert"", in fact, when I read about anybody
using virtual memory regularly I kind of wonder ... ;-) ]

Yes, one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM (of the 
correct size, obviously) in an older machine, but one should be 
prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine 
type rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect 
conclusions when special-casing - especially timing-dependent
and driver-related stuff.

In this particular case I see no reason to go to the trouble 
of ROM-swapping.  The Apple 32-bit enabler has problems, but
MODE32 works just fine with 7.0, 7.0.1, and 7.1.


Sure.  Buy a used IIci motherboard.  Call Pre-Owned Electronics,
Shreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of Computer Shopper
or one of the Mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price
on a IIci ROM.  Everything has a price.  If you happen to find
somebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard, you might
get a decent price.  There is probably a market for used mother-
boards as well, so they might sell a ROM anyway.


Ask for a quote and then try offering less?  Pre-Owned and
Shreve have been known to dicker.  Their ads in various trade
magazines often list considerably different prices for the 
same items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well.

Still, I'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading 
the ROM in a IIx.  ",1

This is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were
killed and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,
not some fictitious ""supression of rebellion.""  Even earlier, one can
point to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of
Muslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the
Serbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum ""The Expulsion of the
Arnauts"" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic
on March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:

   The Mode of Removal
   -------------------

   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed
   through state terror and ""private initiative"", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]

   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should
   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik
   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]
   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,
   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be
   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the
   Chetniks, rather than the army.

   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL
   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages
   and city quarters.

(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually
all Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism
against Muslims, aided by Chetnik ""private initiative,"" has continued in WWII
and today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book ""Od tradicije do 
identiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana"" (Sarajevo:
Svjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca
in WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining
their action as follows:

   ""Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you
   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not
   torture you.""

so the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs
have repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction
of mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the
eradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.



Which part do you claim is untrue?  Explain yourself, or withdraw your claim.


Croatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it
was not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between
Austro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the
end of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism
came into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the
best Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations 
to Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian
nationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As
for your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim
alliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as
yours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  


In international relations 101 you'll learn that unless weak unite to
counterbalance the strong player, soon they are taken over and that's the
end of them.  Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats
and Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are
unstable.  I'm working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and
Muslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  
You are wrong if you think only ""image"" is at stake here.  Croatia has
a deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  

I think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice 
at this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before 
any open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will
survive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse
off.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not
see it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?
If not, then all bets are off.

Mr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.  I'm deeply hurt.
This is not about some ""image"" but about survival of a concept of a
partnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats
and Muslims.  ",4

I'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them

atoricities, then that's an indictment of that theism.  But it rather
depends on what the 'certain circumstances' are.  When you talk about

It's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls

#
#What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic

Not in my opinion.  If they were doing it because of some obscure
point of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don't do this
(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad
too say ""religion did this"".  I'm saying that the causes are far more
complex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still
have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You
know, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the

The general principle is that it's fairly clear (to me, at least) that
religion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.  It's
not nearly so obvious what's going on when one looks at NI, apart
from violence of course.

advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space
to support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done the

'Alone'? Sorry, but the following western scholars are forced to disagree 
with you. During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, 
the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide, 
tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against 
the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and 
deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

Uh, why do they have to ask a state commision? Unless the state's buying...

Such a process will only increace the overhead to the power company
of selling different types of light, and will decreace the likleihood
that they will do so. And any efficient lights they might have been
planning in the future, go down the drain.....


You could order it special. If enough people did so, it would be 
low cost. Last I checked, you could use UPS to buy stuff in Arizona
before going there.

Finally, I'm sure your state has things like small factories and
machine shops. You could go into business making lights that are
cheaper to use (thanks to their higher efficiency and the
fact that they aren't wasting energy on broadcasting to space)
and therefore _better_ than the old style...

	I wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost)
to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would
reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than
some amount of time.  This is pretty standard in portable machines, and the
same kinds of tricks could be played; spinning down disks, turning off
screens, reducing clock speed, etc.  The advantage of this over just turning
the thing off would be 1) you don't have to remember to do anything and 2)
the machine is still available over the network.

	The tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity.
Certainly, you don't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody

months; that energy is just getting turned into heat.  It may not be as
efficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant, but it's
not too bad.  In the summer though, it's a disaster.  Not only are you
wasting that power, but you're probably also running the air conditioning to
get rid of the waste heat.",1

You are somewhat close to truth. But you shouldn't forget that
nationality is a recent invention of the western europe. In the
days of the Ottoman empire, the religion was the main point of
difference between social classes. The Ottomans didn't recognize
Turks, Arabs, Greeks, Serbs... Just christians, muslims, jews...
So, for all the interested parties in the Ottoman society the
bosnian muslims were ""Turks"". After all, there aren't many ""real"" 
(ethnic) Turks living even in Turkey today. Even in Europe, it's
the culture that defines the ethnicity and religion is part of
one's culture.

I don't have the faintest idea what literature it is to which you 
refer. Is this an explicit statement by some document? Or is it your 
interpretation of statements in such literature? Or is this a figment 
of your imagination or a Nazi Armenian propaganda movie script? In 
any case, a fascinating piece of analysis. Here are the facts:


Source: Walker, Christopher: ""Armenia: The Survival of a Nation.""
        New York (St. Martin's Press), 1980.

This generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information
of direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust: 

a) Dro (the butcher), the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the 
architect of the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims, the most respected 
of Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional Republic 
in Berlin during World War II; 

b) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social 
theories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members 
of the Aryan 'Super-Race;' 

c) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves 
with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, 

d) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30,000 members which fought side 
by side with the Wehrmacht.

 
In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast 
network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents. 
Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in 
Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and 
fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. 
They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in 
an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of 
this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1, 
1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians 
were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed 
pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war.


In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi
concentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first
Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion 
had grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of Dro 
(the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the 
architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds 
between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious 
Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged 
by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed 
and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the 
members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of 
extermination of the Jews.

This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore""
performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and
exterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army.

Why?  Your last statement.  Why?  By which authority?  

#Most criminals do not see their behavior as moral.  The may realize that

#may have believed that his actions were moral, we may judge him immoral

#that we must excuse the murderer.

Trouble is, this would sound just fine coming from someone like Hitler, too.
(I do *not* mean any comparison or offence, David.)   Try substituting

"Hi,
I'm having problems tying to get a Sony DAT drive to work.  I'm using
Retrospect 1.3Ci,
and my only luck with getting the drive to work has been with a Mac IIci,
which has
now unfortunately gone to another department.
  Ideally, we want to attach it to our Quadra 950 setup.  I can't seem to
get the
Retrospect software to recognize the media at all.  When in the ""Devices""
dialog,
it can see the DAT device, but comes up with, firstly, 'Running', secondly
'Media Failure' and then immediately 'Contents Unknown'.  This does not
happen with the
Mac IIci setup, which simply says 'Ready'.
  I'm hoping someone else will have had similar problems but found some
solution... I 
know some others who have had problems with DAT devices and their Quadra,
but they have
a Mac IIci which they can use!
  
THE SYMPTOMS
System software is 7.1, also didn't
work with 7.0.1
  I have tried the following:
  Turn off all extensions, except Retrospect SCSI (required)
  Tested on a variety of machines:  Quadra, IIsi, and LC (at least).
  Connected no other SCSI devices
  Tested all varieties of SCSI termination etc.
  Replaced the DAT unit with a new one (Yes!  we got that desperate!)
  Read the Retrospect manual (EVEN MORE DESPERATE :))

Replies via email would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance. 
I'll post any
solutions to this group.

Cheers,
Matt.

No wonder you 'wieneramus' are in such a mess. Following the Greek 
Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek 
army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international 
agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten 
people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose 
grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. And the next is
'Karabag'.

The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek 
Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will 
remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever 
the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece 
was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent
its troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate
government of Archibishop Makarios.

The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization
of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the
'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not
forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks
in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to
destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of
course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences 
for this irresponsible conduct.

             THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM

2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus

It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at
the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched
against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat
Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally
killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage
Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the
24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities
committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which
has been converted into a museum.

AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY
GREEK TERRORISTS

The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the
Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been
going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men
and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal
Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage
bloodshed...

The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a
major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,
are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the
bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their
home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.

Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by
Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded
during the same terrible event.

""On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan
and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.
Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.
Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting
having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River
direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.
Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was
dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought
would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in
the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We
waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing
in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her
arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.
Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house
with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard
voices saying, in  Greek, ""You want Taksim eh!""  and then bullets
started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children
fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,
who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I
heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.

When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and
her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the
neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what
had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to
the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was
brutally murdered.

In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying
""Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?""  I became terrified. I
thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not
dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself
under the double-bed.

An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My
mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some
water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the
bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I
offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who
were all wounded.

We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I
thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed
to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber
and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked
as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.

There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were
operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there
were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.
Ayshe and her daughter.

After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to
Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months
treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,
Greeks arrested me at the Airport.

All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my
detention. They then released me.""

ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER

We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in
which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five
days.

We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some
terrible sights.

In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way
into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A
child's bicycle lay in a corner.

In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three
children piled on top of their murdered mother.

In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the
head.

This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose
family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.

Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

"I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations
rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is
utterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to
BATSE press releases.
The idea behind the statement is as follows: 
     ""if you smack two neutron
      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,
      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a
      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy 
      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes
      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.
      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must
      be wrong.""
As so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who
was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It
may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray
burst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created
may spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding 
medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may
carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All
this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,
Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.
It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one
around (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative
proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the 
so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which
a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black
hole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter
will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal
force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the
black hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,
which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such
events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,
but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate
of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two
scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less
in the failed supernova scenario.

On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must 
ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method
such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,
or finding a definitive signature of some known class of
objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists
have historically not been too successfull in finding the
distance of any object by proving that there is only one
possible way in which the object can work, and therefore
it *must* be so-and-so.",3

The experience you describe is why I don't like to sit with my bike in
gear - I figure there's a chance that I'll be startled in some way and
stall my bike.  And I figure this is more likely than the chance that
I'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time
needed to put the bike in gear.

So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second
evasive manuvers.  I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the line.
(Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country)  If I can't
split (perhaps there isn't room) then I will stop near one side of the
lane so I have an easy escape, and leave my bike in gear until the next
car has stopped.  I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure
it will!  Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to
stop, I haven't had to find out yet.  Some cars have an annoying habbit
of racing up behind you before braking heavilly, so it can be hard to
tell if they are planning to brake or not!

So in summary, position yourself for an easy exit, and then watch your
mirrors until it's all clear.",2

Bill, I think you have a misunderstanding about atheism. Lack of

IMO, the influence of Stalin, or for that matter, Ayn Rand, invalidates your 
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered.  Gullibility, 
blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more 
reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of
fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators
of the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing.  Now, *some*
brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,
I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned
argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction
of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?


Well, there is a glaring paradox here:  an argument that reason is useful
based on reason would be circular, and argument not based on reason would
be irrational.  Which is it?

The first part of the second statement contains no information, because
you don't say what ""the beliefs"" are.  If ""the beliefs"" are strong theism 
and/or strong atheism, then your statement is not in general true.  The
second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an
axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is
used to obtain it.


I can't agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?  To
say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which
I suspect you do not have.

We have an old (1990) external HD attached to the Plus in our lab.  It had

through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin  
rectangular connector.  Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine,  
to put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug.  Since the  
26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside  
down, essentially reversing the pins on the DB25.  He came in and asked if he  
could try out our HD on his SCSI port (it had never been used).  Naive fools  
that we are, we said o.k..  His computer failed to recognize the drive.  Now,  
none of the computers in our lab will recognize it.  We tried Disk Doctor, and

I'll leave questions 1 and 2 to be answered elsewhere, but on question 3)
something in the noos today might be an example of the restoration might be.
Namely, that the Clinton Administration is considering asking the UN to 
establish a police force for Haiti.

I didn't hear any thing that said that the current Govt. of Haiti asked for it,
nor is there any real precedent (barring Somalia) for the UN getting involved
in internal conflicts.

That might also answer question 2). The neo-colonial countries are a diffuse
lot - the UN (Security Council).

And while I am at it, I'll take a stab at 1) - the new colonialism, as defined in
most articles I have read, would entail something of the nature of Trusteeship
under the UN Sec. Council, democracy, aid, education, free-markets, free press
and then out for the colonialists, now assured that there is a ""civilized"" 
country that they have left behind.

Note I don't support this idealized concept, simply because I think it is a
lot of hogwash.

The reference to it's not yet being ethics is dubious. You have used the terms
absolute, objective and others interchangeably. Same with moral values, values,

the same.
 
To the IF. When the If is not fulfilled, your intermission is a waste of time.
Assuming that you don't intend this, it is reasonable to conclude that you
want to argue a point.
 
You have made a interesting statement here, namely that of the disinterested
observer. There is no such thing in morals. Probably the shortest proof for
objective and morality being a contradiction.
 
 
 
Fine. And that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon. I could

loaded terms are fixpoints. Those who deny the morality of freedom make quite
clear what they say, their practice is telling. Yes, there are even those who
are willingly unfree. It is quite common in religions, by the way. For one,
there is a religion which is named Submission.

Labour's enclaves policy in the occupied territories

by Israel Shahak

It is not difficult to discover Israel's policy towards the 
Palestinians at any given time. It can be easily inferred 
from the facts on the ground and from the information 
provided by the Hebrew press. There is one condition, 
though. The torrents of claptrap about ""the peace 
process"" must be totally ignored, as must Israel's official

By concentrating only on the facts, it was early apparent 
that Labour's policies were no different from those of 
Shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their 
more effective implementation.

Likud's policies were accurately described by Ariel 
Sharon in an article, accompanied by a map, in Yediot 
Aharonot last August. The Sharon plan envisaged a 
division of the West Bank into seven, and the Gaza Strip 
into four, ""autonomous"" Palestinian enclaves, all of them 
under Israeli supervision. The total area of these 
enclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the 
territories. The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli 
settlements and the highways built around the enclaves. 
The entire area around Jerusalem, from the outskirts of 
Ramallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem, has already 
been turned into a ""Greater Jerusalem"" where the Arab-
inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded 
by areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for 
them.

Judging from Labour's settlement policy, it may be 
assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number 
of Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had 
planned. But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by 
settlements strategically dispersed along the highways 
remains unchanged. Labour plans only four enclaves in 
the West Bank: two in ""Samaria"" and two in ""Judea"" (i.e. 
north and south of Jerusalem respectively), and no more 
than two in the Gaza Strip. In regard to ""Greater 
Jerusalem"", Labour's policies hardly deviate from 
Sharon's.

A saner version of Likud policy

As some Israeli correspondents at once realised, Labour 
policies were but a saner version of Sharon's 
extravaganza. Last July, Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot that, while ""barely a few months ago"" Labour 
supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond 
the Green Line, ""no specific decision to freeze 
construction in the territories has been taken"". And Uzi 
Benziman wrote in Ha'aretz that ""as far as can be judged 
on the basis of the internal political discussions in 
Jerusalem, Rabin intends to stick to Likud's ways"".

The two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are 
located in ""Samaria"". Therefore the belt of settlements 
around the ""Trans-Samaria Highway"", designed to 
separate those enclaves from each other, is of paramount 
importance. According to the latest data, the percentage 
of Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population 
(apart from East Jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. But 
for the area around the ""Trans-Samaria Highway"", the 
corresponding figure is almost 20 per cent, and it is 
increasing steadily. The situation in the settlements of 
the ""Efrat Block"" south of Jerusalem, designed to sever 
the enclave around Bethlehem from the one around 
Hebron, is pretty much the same. The ""Efrat Block"" is now 
being connected with West Jerusalem by a highway.

The project is costly in the extreme, because the highway 
is designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long 
tunnels. The final decision to build this highway was 
suspended until Rabin's return from his US visit in 
March. The subsequent decision to renew its construction 
can be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a 
whole.

Process of impoverishment

The enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady 
impoverishment of the Palestinians. This is well known 
in Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be 
concerned, including the PLO. In regard to the Gaza Strip, 
the whole process was best described by Ze'ev Shiff in 
Ha'aretz in March. He mentions having seen ""a pamphlet 
issued six years ago by the Civil Administration 
forecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli 
rule in 2000"". His analysis deserves to be quoted 
extensively:

""We continue to steal the Strip's water, even though its 
quality deteriorates from year to year. We continue to 
steal the Strip's tiny land resources, in order to found 
there more and more settlements, as if we deliberately 
want to make the inhabitants despair, and in their 
despair think in termws of having nothing to lose. It is 
by our own doing that the Strip's workers must now 
spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time 
as they spend working. From the military point of view, 
we have kept control of no more than half the Strip's 
area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and 
resources. About a year before Moshe Arens left the 
defence ministry, I heard him saying that we should 
withdraw from the Strip come what may. His argument 
was that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and 
deeper. He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak 
Shamir but he rejected it."" Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too.

Enormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can 
also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being 
implemented. The Qatif Block settlements, founded by 
the first Rabin government of 1974-77, are intended to 
divide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves. Efraim 
Davidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli 
this enterprise is. ""The Qatif Block is now producing 40 
per cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export, and a 
substantial proportion of cut flowers."" He also deals with 
the subsidies the settlers receive, considerably 
augmented by the present government. Owing to them, 
housing units are cheap. The present government does 
not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block. 
""Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage 
for his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels 
($6,500).""

Such data shows that Israel's plans apply whether the 
Palestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to 
work in Israel. The economic motivations were explained 
by Danny Rubinstein in Ha'aretz in March:

""From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be 
sealed off hermetically and all the Strip's workers could 
be barred from entering Israel...Even though accurate 
data is hard to come by, it is indisputable that during the 
last two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving 
daily to work in Israel has markedly decreased, from 
80,000 in the mid'80s to 40,000 today. But the decrease 
is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel 
from Gaza. It is also due to the drastic curtailment of 
demand for Gazan labour in Israel. With unemployment 
in Israel soaring and the construction of apartments 
blocks virtually halted, the workers from Gaza are no 
longer really needed...""

Gaza's total dependence

The entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent 
on Israel. In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has 
been an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli 
factories, mostly footware and textiles. Thousands of 
small workshops, employing an average of four workers, 
get their raw materials or unfinished products, together 
with detailed working instructions, from Israeli factories. 
Rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that 
""the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent 
of that in the West Bank, which in turn stands at half the 
average wage in Israel; and besides the Gazan employer 
does not pay any social security for his employees."" If 
the average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that 
in Israel, the profits of Israeli factories and even of 
Palestinian sub-contractors must be vast.

They are higher still when ""a Gazan sub-contractor 
provides labour to be performed at home, with the 
family's help. The livelihood of tens of thousands of 
Gazans depends on such sub-contracted work."" Many of 
them are women and children, paid about ten shekels 
($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. There can 
be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan 
labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition 
of Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from 
the Strip.

Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from 
what was created straight after Israel's conquest [in 
1967]. In this respect, one should not be deluded by the 
talk, nowadays fashionable, about Israeli gestures 
intended to ""encourage economic development in the 
territories"", As Israeli journalists point out, all permits 
for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval 
by the Shin Bet. ""Behind all the professed goodwill there 
is no desire to solve problems, just the attitude of a good 
colonialist, willing to do something for the benefit of the 
natives, but on condition that they behave nicely, do not 
become rebellious, and never do anything against the 
interests of the metropolis, its economic interests 
included,"" wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February. The 
development of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip 
accords perfectly with Sela's diagnosis.

Sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work. 
""In all branches of the economy, lobbies have been set in 
motion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from 
the threat of any Palestinian competition. The method is 
simplicity itself. As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds 
in persuading the government, or even the trade and 
industry minister alone, a military order is issued 
prohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel. If this 
does not suffice, a Palestinian factory may be denied a 
licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse 
its production."" Among the most active of such lobbies is 
the agricultural one. It has succeeded in limiting exports 
of Gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers) 
not only to Israel but also to Europe, where they 
otherwise might compete with Israeli exports.

Perpetuaring apartheid

Labour's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in 
the territories. The same goal is shared by the US, which 
otherwise could not support the Labour government so 
firmly. In my view one of the reasons the US feels 
happier about supporting Labour than Likud is its 
greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. This 
point was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma'ariv, who 
deplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to 
Likud's inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly 
settlement growth ""occured during the term of office of 
the National Unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which 
Rabin served throughout as the defence minister"". 
Likud's reputation for settling the territories better than 
Labour is false, attributable to the many tiny settlements 
without strategic value founded under Shamir for 
symbolic reasons.

To sum up: Labour's policy, unconditionally supported by 
the US differs from that of Likud primarily in the 
efficiency with which it is implemented. According to 
that policy the territories are to be divided into two 
parts. The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly, 
and the minor part indirectly. In my view, this racist 
scheme is doomed to ultimately fail, but at a horrifying 
price in human suffering. The sooner its true nature is 
recognised, the less suffering it may cause.",4

Glad to hear that the bozo managed to stop.  I've only been riding for
about two years, but here are my rules for traffic light survival:

     - I try to *never* stop just over a hill behind a car.  If I have
       to stop in such a location, I pull almost completely next to the
       car in front of me.  If I'm the only one (ie no car in front), I
       turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane, to increase my
       visibility to any oncoming vehicle.  Make sure to keep your
       taillight visible to traffic, though. (NOTE:  My bike is bright
       white; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.)

     - On a flat road, I stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually
       about two or three bike lengths).  This will (hopefully) give
       me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches.

     - If you are the last in a line of vehicles, watch your mirrors
       *constantly!*  If you see a vehicle approaching, and can't see
       any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down, get out
       of the way *now!*

     - Flicker your brake light.  If I'm the last vehicle in line, I
       will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from
       behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors, of course :-).
       I vary the speed of the flicker, hoping to make the cager notice
       that there's something in the lane ahead of him.

Now, with all that said, it's the situation where you are first in line
that I feel most defenseless.  If you're first in line, your forward escape
route is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent that
you don't enter the intersection.  I leave some room behind the stop line
(although around here, the #@$*! light activators are always right up 
next to the stop line!), and watch the mirrors.  I *think* I've decided
that hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation.
Any other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind
you?

But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here.  The other x
three instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form
an image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the 
resolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different
beast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of 
the craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the 
differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors.
Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors
and errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have
any independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to
determine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small 
component to the positional error.  

Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would 
require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort 
cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together 
now: ""Parallax ARc SECond"", a parsec is the distance of an object 
that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line).
If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to 
have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.

The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and
watches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination
when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from.",3

For what it's worth, I got my can in three days from Chaparral. That's
UPS ground from CA to UT, YMMV. The stuff seems to work, and it doesn't
attract grundge like PJ-1 Blue does. I gave it the acid test, a full
day's worth of breaking in the Quadracer's new paddle tires down at the
sand dunes. If there's anything wet & stickey it will be coated with
sand at the end of the day, but the chain looked pretty clean.

As far as mail-order goes, if Chaparral has it in stock (and they can
tell you if it's in stock, or about how long it will take to back-order
it if it's not), I usually get it in three days. Competition Accessories
always seems to take a week or two to deliver. Motorcycle Accessory
Warehouse also takes a week or two, and after trying to buy some boots
from them last week, I don't think they actually stock anything. MAW was
about $30 cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech 7 boots, but on
Monday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week, so I asked MAW a
completely unreasonable question: ""Do you have them in stock?"" The
conversation went something like this:

I need to know if you have some boots in stock.

	Do you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard?

I want to know if you have them in stock.

	Well, the computer doesn't show anything, I'd have to call the
	distributer to find out if we have them.

So do you have them or not?

	Don't you understand what I'm saying? I have to call our
	distributer to find out if we have them in stock or not.

Uh, right. So can you do it?

	Yea, call me back in an hour, and ask for Phil.

So an hour later Phil isn't there, but Mike says he'll check, and call
him back in half an hour. Half an hour later Mike isn't there either,
but he left a note that says they'll have them by the end of the month
(3 weeks away). Screw it, the 30 bucks isn't worth the hassle. I called
Chaparral and asked if they had them in stock:

	Ooh, Alpinestars? Probably not, they are hard to keep in stock,
	but I'll check. What size?

Size 10.

	Let's see, yes! Size 10, in blue & white, gray & white, black...

I'll take the blacks!

This was about noon on Monday, they arrived Thursday morning. Once
again, three days via UPS ground. I _like_ Chaparral.

I'm not completely down on MAW, they often have lower prices, but be
prepared to wait.

(about my reply)


It a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming, Usenet, diplomacy
is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through, isn't it?


Kevin, unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little
about, algorithms. Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the
lines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical 'insight' cannot
be algorithmic in his book _The emperor's new mind: Concerning
computers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose's
claim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim
that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look,
could be just illusions.

We are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder
on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective,
realising that it might not be anything special, but certainly
useful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds
or not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave 
just like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day
in the future perform a ""total synthesis of C. elegans"" from
the elements. Would such a worm have a mind?


This is true to some extent. However, I do not think that our brains
work like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence
(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less
chaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.
Our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.


Indeed, this is extremely unlikely, given the vast impact of nurture
on our mind and brain. I suggest, however, that before trying to
understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. 

Kevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.
I still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind
are neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not 
flame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are
conscious. 

The reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot
lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.

And please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not
all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness
plays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn't.


Again, _brains are not computers_. Don't forget this. This does not
mean they need something else to work - they just work differently.
Their primary 'purpose' is perception and guidance of action, 
self-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.


You are still expecting that we could find the idea of 'green' in
our brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is
not how I see it. The sensation 'green' is a certain time-dependent
pattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed
with the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. 

Indeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness
as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,
but this is just idle speculation.

Scientific American's September 1992 issue was a special issue on
mind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)
There are two articles on visual perception, so you might be 
interested.

But again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be 
observed from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but 
neuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the
mind.

Kalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation
of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the 
patients' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area
was stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during
a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and
started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.

Stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing
situations, when the patients have started flirting with the
therapist.

In conclusion, there is evidence that

1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, 
   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage

2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in
   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our
   visual cortex is activated etc.

3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our
   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead
   of our 'conscious will' by at least 350 ms. 

Thus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question ""Why do 'I' see
colours"" around and ask ""What is this 'I' that seems to be 
observing?"", since it seems that our conscious mind is not
the king of our brains.


This depends on what is meant by 'seeing colours'. Does a neural
network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from
0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?

If you are asking, ""why does an animal who is conscious of itself
as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who
doesn't"", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,
where I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap
roles and act more morally, so that they don't unconsciously
kill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,
but this is the basic idea.)

When early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, 
a sense of identity and the concept of 'self' had to evolve in
line with this development. Indeed, respect for others and 
conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages
for social animals, such as early humans. 


If minds are required for this, does this mean that until human
minds came to the scene, wavefunctions never collapsed, but remained
in the superpositions for aeons? My, how powerful we are.

This has been discussed before, and I think this topic is irrelevant,
since we do not agree that minds are necessary, and neither do
physicists. 


I agree, but not in the sense you apparently mean above - physics
needs sharp minds to solve many real problems. ;-)

wrote about in my previous posting, plus the following:

	   Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism
   during the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -
   off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of
   Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of
   terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
   Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
   soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in
   favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.

The Irgun killed SOLDIERS,  which is a legitimate way to drive an unwanted
fogriend regime from a country.  They didn't kill blindly their families or
such (not as a policy,  I agree that brits which were not soldiers also were
killed sometimes) nor they killed Arabs just for being Arabs.

In case I have to remind you the difference,  the majority of the attacks of
the Arab terrorist organizations was on civilians.  They even tried to
justify their attacks by saying that all Jews in the Israel served in the army
at one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets.

   In addition, they
   massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing
   to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their
   very lives.

Yes, these exceptions were tragic mistakes.  I wasn't there and don't have
reffereces handy but from what I heard your description is a bit carried away,
most of the vilagers fled with several dozens,  most of them claimed to be
fighters being killed.

Those ""massaceres"" are far from being the rule considering that dozens if not
hounders of Arab vilages came under Israeli rule during the same time period.

	   I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part
   Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the
   Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the
   Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
   Jews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for
   German and European anti semitism.

What do you mean ""screwed over by the Jews""?  They began the '47 war and
didn't accept the arrgenment planned by the U.N.,  what did you expect the
Jews to do??

Man, what *is* your pill wrt atheists? If you're going to make such
contentious statements, back them up! At least, READ NEWS: time-and-time

": >Why not build a inflatable space dock.

: If you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in
: a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether
: anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near
: future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.

That's a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked ""Why not,"" I'll
respond.

Putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other
factors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature control
is difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to 
incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable).
Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required.
Don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likely
to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer
fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.

Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used
their pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though
they had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.

The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The
space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to
temperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation
effects on materials), so your ""fabric"" may not retain any flexibility
for long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure
changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could
lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.

These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal
for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of
success.

: Very true (length of time for discussions on creationism vs evolutionism). 
: Atheists and Christians have been debating since ?? and still debate with 
: unabated passion 8-).

Mike,

I've seen referrences to ""Creation vs Evolution"" several times in a.a
and I have question. Is either point of view derived from direct
observation; can either be scientific? I wonder if the whole
controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the ""Truth""
rather than the truth itself. 
Both sides seem to hold to a philosophical outcome, and I can't help
wondering which came first. As I've pointed out elsewhere, my view of
human nature makes me believe that there is no way of knowing
anyhthing objectively - all knowledge is inherently subjective. So, in
the context of a.a, would you take a stand based on what you actually
know to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell
the difference?",0

I have no idea what this guy means but the Syrian Jews are not allowed
to leave Syria because Assad welshed on his promise and is not letting
them go. Israel has nothing to do with it.

As for the other Arab countries there are still small communities left
in some Arab countries. Morocco has the largest group I think comprising
perhaps just over a thousand (but I have lost the exact figure. Maybe
someone will be so kind as to post it). There are communities left in
Yemen (which went to the polls yesterday in what might appear to be a
free-ish election), Algeria (this is a tiny group, a couple of leftist
intellectuals I think), of course Syria and Lebannon.

The circumstances of the departure of the Jews from various Arab countries
is controversial in some cases - like Iraq - and I do not want to get into
a dispute about it. Egypt expelled most of its community outright. Most of
the French North African Jews left rather than face Independence. I think
that Moroccans might have been encouraged by some AntiSemitic acts but I
am not sure. Someone else around here will know for sure. There are claims
that Israeli intellegence officers spread rumours around Algeria that the
Jews would not be welcome but this is probably just propaganda. It would
take a very stupid person not to realise the benefits of a move to France
(as most did) or to Israel. Yemeni Jews were airlifted to Israel. Those
left were rumoured to have another airlift last year but I heard nothing
about it so I guess it was just a rumour. Any I left out except Iraq?

I'd buy that for two reasons.  The tubes for TV's and radios (if you can
still find them) are usually 3x or more expensive than comparable transistors.

Also, ask any electric-guitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer, and
they'll tell you tube-type, since tubes have lower distortion and noise
than transistors.  'Course, most of your electric guitar types just say
""Tubes sound better, dude."" :-)

Also, transistors have the advantage in both waste-heat and energy-use,
mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes.

Anton LaVey's interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me.  I
read his ""Satanic Bible"" a few years ago for a social studies project,
as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called ""The Cult of Devil Worship
in America.""  The latter included a very interesting interview with
the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an
instrument for one to realize the self.  

When I refer to Satanism, I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic
ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  I
don't consider LaVey's church to be at all ""orthodox,"" nor do I consider
its followers ""satanists.""  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche,
Crowley, and Reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a little
touch of P.T. Barnum, and christened his creation the Church of Satan.
No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...I
suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.

At any rate, it worked (for a while).  In its heyday, the Church had a
huge following, including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr.
and Jayne Mansfield.  (I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy, by the 
way.)  

I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as
a Christian not believing in Christ.  But if you include the Church of
Satan, then I suppose I need to alter my definition.  Webster's Dictionary
and The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same.",0

Well Bosnia and the US did...the UN cannot impose blue berets on

not be responsible for the policy he wants to dictate.  If Clinton
asks for the blue berets to leave, then he Bill Clinton becomes
responsible for what happens...him and Sen. Biden and their friends

are there Clinton can use Europe as a scapegoat for American

Consider special relativity.  It hasn't be proved, nor has it been
disproved.  No one has a proof one way or the other, but many people
are interested in it!
 
I've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the
existence of God one way or the other.  The two possibilities
are supernaturalism and naturalism.  Of course no set of circumstances can
be inconsistent with supernaturalism, but similarly, no set of circumstances
can be inconsistent with naturalism.  In naturalism, any phenomenon that
could be described as God is considered part of the natural world, to
be studied as any other natural phenomenon (gravity, for instance).  
For example, if a loud ``godlike'' voice vociferously announced, ``I
am God, I exist, and I will prove it by reversing the force of gravity,''
and if then gravity did indeed reverse, a naturalist (probably a scientist)
would say, ``Boy, we sure didn't understand gravity as well as we
thought we did, and that loud voice is something new.  Perhaps we
didn't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either.''


I'm sure glad you don't know where I live, since you don't seem
to realize it is impossible for you to distinguish between voices
in your head, and God's voice.

You don't *need* to, but it's desirable.  HST, like all satellites in

You can do a whole hell of a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with
the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network.
Ignore the directional information from BATSE; just look at the time
of arrival.  With three detectors properly arranged, one can often
get positions down to ~arc minutes.

BTW, about Oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the
fairly near future?  Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1
ms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a
distance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing
and t the time resolution.  For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU, this is on the
order of 16 light years.  I understand statistics will reduce this
number considerably, as would geometry if the burst is coming from the
wrong direction.",3

My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but 
got a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering 
the confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO 
inalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive 
of liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out 
of my site.    (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these 
rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) 



Anyway, here are my thoughts on this: 


I'd like to add that some of the ""protests"" do not come from a strictly 
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for 
research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I 
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may 
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - 
unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars 
as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and 
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time 
- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. 
Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there 
and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief 
in an afterlife.  

The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks 
and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light 
crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people 
is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating 
the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or 
thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  
But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. 

Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live 
in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport 
currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The 
impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists 
that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped 
into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life 
forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels 
(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains 
one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, 
malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed 
the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 
miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters 
much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of 
high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. 

But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't 
fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - 
like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch 
commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, 
truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  
If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at 
least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last
beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  

To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage 
of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 
8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the 
local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it 
if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could 
be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky 
while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that 
as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, 
even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.

Well, yes.  This is the real mystery of the matter, and why I am rather
dubious of a lot of the source theories.

There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text (MT) of the OT is
obscure and presumably corrupted.  These are reproduced exactly from copy to
copy.  The DSS tend to reflect the same ""errors"".  This would appear to tell
us that, at least from some point, people began to copy the texts very
exactingly and mechanically.  The problem is, we don't know what they did
before that.  But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the
point at which the texts are perceived as texts.  They may be added to (and
in some situations, such as the end of Mark, material is lost), but for the
most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text.

You're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  Some people
like to use the game of ""telephone"" as a metaphor for the transmission of
the texts.  This clearly wrong.  The texts are transmitted accurately.",0

Nobody ever produced the meagerest evidence for this.  It does not
appear in several long published accounts by Irgun participants.
Even some Irgun propagandists do not make this claim.


Several members of the Irgun attacking party, including the leader,
deposited personal declarations in the Irgun archives (Jabotinsky
Institute, Tel-Aviv) which state that the Lehi proposed to ""liquidate
the village after the conquest"".  It seems the Begin overruled
this plan, however the willingness of many of the attackers to
seriously consider this possibility serves as instructive
character evidence.


The Haganah tried to get the Irgun to attack a village with
real military significance, but it was considered too hard.  
The soft target of Deir Yassin was chosen instead.


There was intention (probably originating with Begin) to give such
a warning but the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch before
reaching the village.  Everyone knows that.

Muslims,

This kind of racialist generalization is utterly inappropriate.  SOME
Bosnian Muslims cooperated with the Nazis in World War 2.  Other Bosnian
Muslims risked their lifes to hide Jews from the Nazis and Ustashe, and
those Jews who survived the war remember that.  In fact the Jewish leader
in Sarajevo has remained there saying he wants to repay the debt to the
Bosnian Muslims that saved so many Jewish lives in WW2.

Similarly, SOME Serbs are ""doing"" to Muslims now. This is a group of
serial-killers, rapists, and thieves who have control of the vast
Yugoslav army arsenal.  Many other Serbs oppose these atrocities.  As one
of Serbian heritage who condemns emphatically the genocide being carried
out against Muslims by both HVO and Mladic forces, I condemn your
generalization about Bosnian Muslims and about Serbs.


 This is not a fresh case of

Every place on earth is the scene of a saga of mutual hatred and
destruction.  The holocaust was not a ""fresh case.""  It was another
chapter in a 900 year history of attacks on Jews in Europe.  That didn't
make it acceptable. and Balkan history does not make the genocide against
Bosnian Muslims acceptable.

Not taking sides in this

Standing by and allowing well-armed criminals to slaughter Bosnian Muslim
civilians, while enforcing an arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims is
not only religious bigotry it is direct complicity in mass-murder.

Absolutely not true. Without religion - either an established one or
one you invent for yourself - the theist and atheist are equally
(not) interested in God, because without religious revelation there
is _no_ information about God available. Strip away the dogma and
the theists/atheists are no different, simply holding a different
opinion on a matter of little practical importance.


Sorry, but that doesn't help. What test will you apply to decide
whether it is God or Satan with whom you are speaking?

"Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress:
                          The Next Step
                          
        The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase 
Act is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point,  many
congresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,
for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best
possible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his
position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,
Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long
record of support and interest in space development, and helped
pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements
Act.                      
        There is a small group of activists in southern California 
who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.
We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown
about the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space
constituents to let him know that they care about getting
America back to the Moon.
        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert 
for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him
introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late
spring, 1993.
        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's
office. As more is known, it will be passed on.
        However, even if we are successful in getting him to support
the bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For
any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:
either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an
issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be
propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or
have widespread support within Congress, due to small, but
widespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,
by necessity, must choose.                    
        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources 
Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number
of congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish
this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support
the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the
bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a
congressperson's staff review a bill.
        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet
introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently
written. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists
and politicians.
        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please
request a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service
address), or contact your local chapter of the National Space
Society).",3

Only if he doesn't spend more than a billion dollars doing it, since the
prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort.  You can
spend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches.

What's more, if you buy Titans, the prize money is your entire return on
investment.  If you develop a new launch system, it has other uses, and
the prize is just the icing on the cake.

I doubt very much that a billion-dollar prize is going to show enough
return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current
US launchers.  (There would surely be a buy-American clause in the rules
for such a prize, since it would pretty well have to be government-funded.)
You're going to *have* to invest your front money in building a new launch
system rather than pissing it away on existing ones.  Being there first is
of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it.

'Propagandist leaflets'? This is an American officer on the 
genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between
1914 and 1920, not a crook/idiot like yourself.


Source: ""World Alive, A Personal Story"" by Robert Dunn. Crown Publishers, 
Inc., New York (1952). 
(Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 
 million Muslim people)

p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph).

 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.'
 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-'
 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.'
 ""We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space....
 'I don't believe you,"" I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The 
  man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. 
  I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and 
  went inside.

 The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for 
 its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an 
 iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black 
 with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As 
 the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face 
 up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what 
 was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, 
 as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so 
 I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his  
 slashed genitals.""

p. 363 (first paragraph). 

 'How many people lived there?'
 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.
 'Did you see any Turk officers?'
 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'

 ""The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - 
 Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled
 so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into 
 laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense
 of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,
 Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would
 have been.

 From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....
 The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over
 the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last 
 scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, 
 looms, even spinning-wheels.

 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must 
 leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And 
 for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. 
 Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in 
 a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'""

p. 354.

""At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole
 high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,
 but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust
 of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on
 Moslem villages.""

p. 358.

""It will be three hours to take,"" Dro told me. We'd close in on three
 sides.
""The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,"" Merrimanov
said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.
""That is for morale,"" Dro put in. ""We must keep the Moslems in terror.""
""Soldiers or civilians?"" I asked.
""There is no difference,"" said Dro. ""All are armed, in uniform or not.""
""But the women and children?""
""Will fly with the others as best they may.""

p. 360.

""The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet 
 down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said 
 Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'

 Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets
 clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;
 then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the
 spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though 
 I heard our Utica brass roar.

 As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing
 of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,
 dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow
 puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.
 The came a shrill wailing.

 Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about
 house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in
 clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen
 were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.

 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape
 over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked
 breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by
 afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and
 the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.

 At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward
 Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and 
 tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,
 through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-
 arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.""

p. 361 (fourth paragraph).

""Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, 
 large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble 
 where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet 
 had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between 
 the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun 
 dress.

 The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He 
 lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the 
 pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed 
 just below his neck, into the spine. 

 There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was 
 empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking 
 colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead.""

p. 358.

 ""...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled
  north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands, 
  Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar -
  coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would 
  break loose if Versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'Armenian'
  vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan...

  An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips
  smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. That's bloodshed - just
  Smyrna over again on a bigger scale.""

Biden spoke well.  Then there was John Major, the architect of the
betrayal of Bosnian Muslims to genocide.  

He basically has given yet another green light to HVO Ustashe and
Mladic-Chetnik serial killers, rapists, and plunderers to continue their
genocide against Bosnian Muslims.

But Major met with Mr. Rushdie and said it was ""unacceptable"" that Iran
should have a death decree on him.  While I disagree personally with
Fetwas against hack writers like Rushdie (it only helps them sell more

The late rabbi never hated anyone merely for having been born into a par-
ticular group, but he (and I) hate and would/will kill anyone who comes
to kill Jews. I recall VERY well Rabbi Kahane's words to the Iraqis at a
demonstration: ""You want peace? Here is our hand (holding out an open
hand)! You don't want peace? Here is our hand (holding out a fist)!""

Don't be silly.

Using the Sound Manager on a Quadra is very well, but using SM on
any of the low-end machines doesn't simply work for a decent action
game since it just steals too much time from the CPU. This is
a fact. By writing directly to the hardware on an SE, it is
possible to have 4 simultaneous channels of sampled sound (11kHz) for
a cost of approx. 8000 cycles. Exactly how would you do that using
the SM, pray tell?

The correct thing to do is to use the SM on the machines that can
carry that extra load using the SM means, and to write directly
to the sound hardware on the machines that can't. It's not the
politically correct thing, but from the developers' point of
view it is.

It is my understanding that Croats were allies of Germany during
WWII, while Serbs had sided with Russia.  As a result Serbs did
take a beating from Croats (NOT Bosnian Moslems) while Germany
had the upper hand.

Even today, Russians consider/call Serbs as their Slovac brothers.
This is one of the issues involved in the U.N.'s lack of active
intervention against Serbs.

As for the Bosnian Moslems, I have not heard of any alliance with

  Tim, you're missing the big sleight-of-hand here.  I can accept every
  word quoted from Halabi and still have ZERO evidence of any mosques
  being razed.  Note that what Halabi refers to is not that mosques
  were razed but that people PROTESTED alleged razing.  Too well we
  know that this is a common demagogic tactic (or has anyone forgotten

"So, Mr. Salah is still claiming Stalin was a Jew? 

This thread began on SCA, when he and another guy claimed both Stalin
and Lenin were Jews. When I posted evidence from books and the Britannica
showing they were Christians, someone made the (correct) remark that
Lenin's maternal grandfather was a Jew who converted to Christianity.

To counter the fact that Stalin was a Christian who, during his youth,
was trained to be a priest, Mr. Salah wrote ""yes, it says he was trained
to be a priest, but not for what religion!"" (BTW, Stalin developed
strong antisemitic feelings later in his life).

Mr. Salah seems intent on trying to spread hate against Jews by posting
antisemitic forgeries and trying to ""prove"" that certain notorious
people were Jews, even if they were not.

I've had the same experience actually. I love the Mac interface and any number
of the features, but am sorely dissapointed with the speed. I use macs daily
and am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department; I'm familiar with almost
every model out there, and my experience is that both the Amiga and the Atari
ST simply ""blow the Mac out of the water"" in terms of performance. At this time
I would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh the
advantages of the Amiga or the ST (and Falcon), but I really wish Apple would
get their heads together on speed... :-((((( They could take a real lesson in
muli-tasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too :-(((

I just hope that someone comes out with a machine that does *everything* well
someday. If I had my choice, I would go with Mac in most aspects, but add the
speed and superior Multi-Tasking of the other platforms.

As for the original topic; Trying to compare *just the chip* in a machine seems
almost worthless. A fast 386 with a wiz-bang graphics accelerator will be
faster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra. Add a
graphics accelerator to a 486 and you *really fly*. Of course, add one the the
Quadra and then you're blowing the 486 away... etc...

How about the following scholarly source?

Source: Pierre Oberling, ""The Road to Bellapais: The Turkish Cypriot
        Exodus to Northern Cyprus"", Social Science Monographs, Boulder,
        1982, ISBN 88033-000-7.


Well, I am forced to disagree with you. The Greeks started massacring 
the Turkish population on Cyprus in 1974. In 1974, Turkiye stepped into 
Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is 
nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, the intervention 
was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing 
numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been 
planned for a peaceful minority.

The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots 
will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain 
eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the 
cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was 
the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops 
on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of 
Archibishop Makarios.

The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization
of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the
'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not
forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks
in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to
destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of
course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences 
for this irresponsible conduct.

Turkish Cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a
repeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the Greeks' EOKA. If 
such assurances are not perfectly implemented, there is every reason 
to expect that the local Greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate 
their past mistakes. On such an occasion, the Turkish side may not find 
it satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before, 
for it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical 
vicious attacks. Therefore it would be better to have a true federation
of two separate sections living in obligatory peace, rather than another 
armed confrontation that would be started by the Greeks and obligatorily 
but decisively terminated by the Turks. 

The present Greek government is trying to tyrannize the Turkish population 
in western Thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights, which 
were established through international treaties. One might be better
advised to remember that misadventures against Turkiye do not serve 
Greece well.

An offer of membership in the European Common Market as bait for concessions 
that may doom the Turks in Cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for 
Greece or her friends. Neither Turkish lives nor Turkish honor has been 
placed on the bidding block to be sold for commercial gain.

If the clutch is in, then a large chunk of counter-rotating mass is not
rotating.  Hence, at a light, reving makes it twist.  Shaft effect is the
rear end rising under power or (the real problem) getting lower to the road
when the throttle is snapped shut (say when you are cornering and the heads
are real close to the road).  New GS bikes with the paralever shaft have
almost no shaft effect.



It's a question of how long you spend at low RPM and how much you need the
extra light.  At low RPM, 3K and under, they don't charge all that much if
at all.  The alternators put out sufficient wattage, it just that you need
to be at 4K RPM to get it.  


Full choke.  Open the gas taps.  Hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the
throttle.  It should fire.  Cranking should be done with minimal throttle.
My R100 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle.

It's an EXPERIENCE thing.  Like Zen, it's hard to describe.  It can be hard
to learn if you aren't paying atttention to the differences between success
and failure.  Especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the
battery while trying to get it to run.

If my bike has been sitting for a few weeks, I give it a short while to
start.  If it doesn't, I turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to
vaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off.  I've got dual
plugs which make it easier to start.


The BIG fix is the Bing carb upgrade kit.  It's good for a few MPG and the
parts are alcohol proof.  The parts it replaces aren't alcohol proof.  As
long as the bike isn't going to sit for long periods of time, gasohol is
nice since it helps keep ping away.  If your bike doesn't ping on cheap gas
you ought to raise the compression! (Half a smiley, the BMW twins of the
80s and beyond have lowered compression to keep the EPA happy.  Dual plugs
and higher compression give back a big chunk of the lost perfomance).",2

Not their party - them as *individuals*. Even when they belong to nice
peaceful Zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome. Arabs are
excluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse. It
sure looks like racism to me.

Arabs are excluded from cabinet, even when they do the things you

reason? I am happy to listen to any good reason why a leftist Jew

This is one of those ""yes, but"" things. It's true that a hydraulically
pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube,
but even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily,
though it's straight-on compressive strength is high, and it's torsional

there's no doubt that hydraulic ""leverage"" exists in nature. Tree roots 
are an example. Given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure
increases.


Kangaroos 3-limbed? I don't think so. If you take the view that the
tail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the
tail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case
of the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather
than locomotion. I don't know much about panda ""thumbs"", so I'll ask
is it opposable?


Well I won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent, but I'll
bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I
don't think it's likely. First let me say that when I say ""intelligent""
I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level
with, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming
suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter 
it's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly not
a universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice
for a putative technological alien.

Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but
it's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level
of complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron
cells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur
wouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument
is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's room
for a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One
reason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages 
that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult
for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very
large creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains.
Instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule out
intelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.

Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the
lemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly
lost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature
that must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time
to develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.
The dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production 
because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. 
I'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical
reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would
tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that
of humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded
creatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that
some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature
the size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrained
or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the
waste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the
ocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence
to manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the
environment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur
would be capable of that much activity.

little problem.  I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that

This is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts are
usually more complex than this example I will use here.
        Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration
of 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds,
its flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the
time.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.
        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several
different spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the
galaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a
R=8800Mpc.  
        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the
old standby formula:
                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak
        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty
energetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.
And lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call
moderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out that

"REPOST - DUE TO NET PROBLEMS

Hi,
   I have problems with the FDHD on a IICX that EKG reports is ROM
revision 376. I had reports that this Mac was having trouble 
formatting disks and by the time I got to it, the FDHD just would
not respond although all other functions were fine.

I checked the voltages on the DB19 external drive connector and pin
6 showed no volts with 7 and 8 giving 25volts unloaded. The power 
supply is an Astec and I sent it away for repair.

With the power supply reinstalled, I now get the following error:

With the internal FDHD connected, the Mac boots fine but on completion
of boot cycle an alert displays ""The disk is unreadable - do you
want to eject it?"". For every combination of response, the alert 
reappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous. The
FDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapable
of ejecting the disk. This error sequence occurs regardless of whether
there is a floppy in the drive or not. Pin 6 on the DB19 external 
connector shows 1.2V, pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.

With the internal FDHD disconnected, the Mac boots fine and works great 
(MacEKG reports no errors). The DB19 external connector now shows
no voltage on pin 6 but pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.

Now, the internal FDHD may be fubar, but I have an apple 800K external
drive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when
connected to either the external DB19 or the internal connector at J16
(after suitable surgery to the external drive). The voltages at J16 
(with the internal FDHD disconnected) are as follows:

	PIN	Volts	PIN	Volts
	1	-	2	5
	3	-	4	5
	5	-	6	5
	7	-	8	-
	9	-	10	5

"Just one little thing. Last year, mid-december, a cop pulled me over. It 
was about -10 Centigrade, and it just started snowing (O.K. you are right, I 
live in Canada). The cop checked my license, insurance, ownership, looked at 
my frozen nose and fingers, told me to watch the speed limit more closely, 
and, entering his cruiser, told me, I was doing 68 instead of 50 km/h. 
Didn't ticket me, and I REALLY slowed down after that ( I already mentioned 
it started to snow. )

OK. Lets look into this.
According to my dictionary,
Zi-on-ism: an international movement orig. for the establishment of a Jewish
national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of
modern Israel.

Now, I do not support the establishment of nations based on religious 
principles, while I support the establishment of nations based on cultural
identities.

So. Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer. My point
is what someone said long time ago: In politics, like with men, it is important
to distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually
doing.

1) My mother is Jewish (and so is my father). If I apply for the Law of
Return, do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land, from which my
family was expelled about 2000 years ago?
2) If I go back, which nationality would my ID show?
3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been 
expelled 2000 years ago, but first I convert to any other religion, can I 
apply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I 
apply as someone whose mother is Jewish?
4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)?
5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted
to loose my being part of the Jewish Nation?
6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife, who is non-Jewish in
Israel, how do I do it?
7) How would my situation change if I decided, after going back to
Israel, to convert to Islam?


Now, here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a country
do not care about politics. They just want to be left alone.
Suppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place 
which now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather as
well as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.
Now suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all the
fighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among 
people he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the same
god. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country. 
And, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created
where my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel.
And, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. And
that people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and
granted full-citizenship.
Should I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as
20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and
ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000
years?

Then, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant.
I am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in 
Zionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew.
How would those who are Zionist define a Jew?

"
Well, let's delve one level deeper. Why is democracy better than tribalism or
other means of Govt.? The President of Georgia was elected with a thumping
majority and booted out later, w/ no objections from the UN. Similarly, the
people of Algeria elected an Islamic Fundemantalist Party into power but the
junta declared it illegal. In both cases, I personally have _no_ problems with
the outcome, but if the voice of the people is that hallowed thing that the 
world community claims to revere so, why isn't it interfering there? 

.
Exactly. My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way, and we can save
ourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their
problems on their own. Colonial interventions, even in Haiti, haven't worked 
in the past. They had a 102 coups from 1845-1915. The US invaded in 1915. And left
in 1933, almost 17 years after they had intended to. Was it a success? Well,
look at Haiti today and of the past 40 years and decide for yourself. It _was_
a success so long as the US was in, from what I remember. But it didn't last
long, obviously.


Nobody did. People should have a right to self-defense. If the UN wants to arm
the Bosnians or Haitian revolutionaries or whoever, I have no problems with
that. I do when they cross that line and attempt to re-arrange boundaries, govts.
etc., the Vance-Owen plan being one such piece of insanity.
 

We finally have a clearly-stated point of difference. Colonialism can
have its good side, which is as you stated above - removing thugs from being
able to lord it over powerless people. I am worried that the bad side is what 
will assert itself, and I am prepared to let natural forces take their course 
if that will mean we can avoid the bad side of colonialism.

"REFLECTIONS ON BOSNIA

LORD OWEN AND THE SERBS

In early February '93, Lord Owen made appearances in New York City
on the Donahue and Charlie Rose shows. On a couple of occasions on
those shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he
made the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in
dispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled
and occupied by Serbs before WWII.  It was as if he were saying
that since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and
lost them during the Hitler years, they should be allowed to
reconquer them today.

I was familiar with this view because my father, a Yugoslav Jew
who escaped to this country during the war, was aided and found
sympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years.  In recent
months when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned, my
father would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Nazi
and pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha.  My father is
so pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. My
father also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis,
because, my father said, Anthony Lewis ""is always talking about
the Muslims.""

Update--April 28, 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around
Sbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and
the killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton
administration dithers its response.  In the days leading to the
collapse of resistance at Sbernica, Lord Owen changed his tune.
Previously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds
that it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forces
began to march on Sbernica, the threat to U.N. relief soldiers
went unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention
to stop Serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes.  The
current disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West
and a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to
halt the Serbs. Now that it's too late to save Muslim areas that
Lord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state, Lord Owen belatedly
calls for strong action.

CLINTON AND BOSNIA

In the summer of 1992, George Kenney, a senior State Department
official, the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk, made
news when he resigned from the State Department because of the
Bush administration's refusal to take any action to halt Serbian
aggression.  As Kenney saw it, Bush's inaction was largely due to
the president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by
getting involved there.

Apparently the same is true of the Clinton administration.
Clinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did
about the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect has
so far been the same.

According to the New York Times, (4/16/93) the Clinton
administration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March
report by its own experts which called for military action if
necessary to protect ""safe havens"" for the Muslims. At one point,
Senate majority leader, George Mitchell was so incensed that the
report was kept from Congress, that he called for an
investigation.

Instead of helping the desperate Bosnians, Clinton has signalled
again and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what
they want in Bosnia--indeed, Clinton and the West have been
signalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish
off the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other
way.  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would
NOT send in American military forces on the ground.  On this
issue, Clinton has made me wistful for Bush.  Bush and Baker could
not have done worse, and might have been pressured to do better
well before this time.  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and
the destruction might have been curtailed..

The Nation, the left and ""the Bosnian QUANDARY""

Typical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core
issue involved in Bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroying
hundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the ""Bosnian
quandary"" in The Nation (4/26/93).  In the end the editorial votes
to do nothing, even while noticing ""the ghastly atrocities of the
Bosnian Serbs""  and that the ""greater and lesser powers...dither
and fuss [and] hang back."" (""Before anything else happens, the
Clinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the United
States owes the"" U.N. the editorial concludes.)

In its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that
""those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side
of the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World
War II.""  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the
Bosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients
including the Chileans, the South Africans, the Greek fascists and
others. (In a subsequent column for The Nation, Christopher
Hitchens correctly called this editorial, ""contemptible."")

***

William Pfaff, a European based journalist who writes for the The
New Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, is among a group of liberal
columnists like Anthony Lewis, and Leslie Gelb who have clearly
and consistently called for strong Western and American
intervention to stop the Serbs.  Pfaff's most recent column
(Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled ""International
Cowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy.""

He clarifies the international failure which has led to present
situation in one sentence. ""Having refused to intervene to
sanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent
Croatia in June 1991, or to block or penalize the military
aggression by Serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious
""ethnic cleansing"" which followed that, the United Nations now
contemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which
two years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since
experienced.""  He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged
call for a ""more daunting and open-ended military assignment than
a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have
been a year ago.""

Aryeh Neier on the Serbs In his ""Watching Rights"" column in the
The Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the
motivation of the ""aggressors""--the preferred term for the Serbian
forces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than
a year.  He explains that ""there is no  military purpose that is
served by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Above
all, few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would
want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt.  They are
not city people.

""It is this, I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of
Bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at
any price--that explains the conduct of the siege of
Sarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist and
cosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation.

""Historically, most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and
Herzegovina has been rural, while Muslims, who were the civil
servants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule,
made up a disproportionate share of the urban population....The
destruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility
against this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....The
demagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war
exploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred
for all that is cosmopolitan.""

The light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is
at stake.  The Serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist,
fundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban,
cosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea.  They are attacking
the rest of us, just as Hitler did. One irony is that at the
beginning of the crisis over Bosnia, it was for awhile maintained
by the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a
threat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state.

Neier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat to
secularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy.  It's the
Serbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democratic
idea.

Anthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does
respect for Clinton's presidency ""depend...on his acting
effectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because to
do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values
we and our allies profess.""  (Times, 4/26/93) But it's not merely
a betrayal of our values.  It's because the Serbs are attacking us
by proxy, just as Hitler was.

One argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a
different form, is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for
Europe.  We hear it as, the Bosnians are Europe's Palestinians;
that is to say, just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been
the key to instability in the Middle East, just so will the
hundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities
result in turmoil in Europe for decades to come.

One of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though
the Atlantic Ocean divides us, the Americas are ultimately tied to
the destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized, the U.S. will
inevitably be affected and drawn into its problems.  As in a
whirlpool,  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom.
And as past history and Pfaff have shown, it's much better if we
do so decisively, quickly and on our terms.",4

An extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja.

Owww.

Well, I hate to be a wet sock, but, well...

I was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I started
riding myelf, and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes.  The passenger
seats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren't
even usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and my
back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of the
reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had
a BMW. :)

I'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains
or some such.  Then see how much pain she's in, and proceed from there.

The best advice I'd give a beginning passenger:

- Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort
  signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on 
  the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready, and at the stop
  he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off.

- Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don't wiggle (unless your rider
  asks you to :)

- The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements
  and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,
  but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.

- Get used to your rider's shifting style (Riders:  use a reasonably
  consistent shifting style).  Avoid ""helmet bonk.""  Helmet bonk is 
  when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change
  in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It
  gets old real fast.

- When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep
  your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands
  on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain,
  but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.

- Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be 
  sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're
  still there. :)  The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider.

- Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or
  losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed 
  for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.

Matthew said many stood far off, including Mary Magdaline, Mary the mother of
James, and the mother of Zebedee's children.  Mark and Luke speak of many far
off, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less.
John says that Jesus's mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and
Mary Magdalene.


Matt.27:46,50: ""And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, 
saying, ""Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?"" that is to say, ""My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?""  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice,
yielded u the ghost.""

Luke23:46: ""And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, ""Father, unto
 thy hands I commend my spirit:"" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.""

John19:30: ""When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, ""It is 
finished:"" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.""


Matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an
earthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves
opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to
many (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and
the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints. 
John is the only one who mentions Jesus's side being peirced.


Matthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being
stolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was
supposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.

Depends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will
spend ""three days and three nights in the heart of the earth"", and Mark 10:34
has ""after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again"". As far as I can
see from a quick look, the prophecies have ""after three days"", but the
post-resurrection narratives have ""on the third day"".


Matthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it
was dark.


MAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first
day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.

MAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother 
of  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and
anoint him.

JOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it 
was  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the
sepulchre.


MAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the
Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,
and sat upon it.
MAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as
snow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as
dead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear
not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

MAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on 
the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.

LUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,
behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

JOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and 
the  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.


Matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes
this claim.


Matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told
them, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went
to a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only
appearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses
to the visit with the disciples.

Mark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that
they told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he
appeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.

Luke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to
Emmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but
was unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally
recognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,
they told the
disciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,
frightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish
and honey and then preached to them.

John says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in
Jeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but
Thomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined
the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.	Once
more Jesus made an
appearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not
recognised.
 After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus
becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat
together and converse.

The book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed
himself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus
contradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things
pertaining to the kingdom of God: ""And when he had spoken these things, while
they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. 
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood
by them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
gazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,
shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven"" Acts 1:3-11

Paul outdoes every other ""authority"" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500
persons between the time of the resurection and the
assension, although he does not say where.	He also claims that he himself ""as
one born out of due time"" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.


Matthew says nothing about it.	Mark casually says that Jesus was recieved into
heaven after he was finished talking with the
disciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that
while he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. 
John says nothing about it.  Acts
contradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)


MAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all
these things be fulfilled.

MAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till
all these things be done.

LUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till
all be fulfilled.

1 thessalonians 4:15-18

1 Corinthians 15:5 (12)
Matthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12)
Acts 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection)
MAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain
where Jesus had appointed them.

	""And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."" (2 Kings 2:11)

	""No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, 	...
the Son of Man."" (John 3:13)

As you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the
trial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses,
you would think that they could get SOME of these important details right! 
(In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think
that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly
observing!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error,
the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.
(Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of
truth.)",0

Apart from the fact that you get G in the pull-out, not the dive, that
figure is about right for sustained G, no protection.
The duration of G, it's rate of onset, body position and support aids are
all critical parts of the equation. I remember one note about instrumented
gridiron players recording peaks about 200G. Stapp, the aviation doctor,
either by accident or design, took a short-period 80G in a rocket-sled
decelleration, eye-balls-out against a standard (1950's) harness. It had
to be short, calculate the stopping time, even from 500 - 600mph at that
G. A bang-seat can get up to about 60 G, and you'd better be sitting
straight. Find the book by Martin-Bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad
it can get if the rate of onset is too high. A reclining position and a
good G-suit can keep a pilot functioning at around 12G.

A flotation tank should be a good bet, since you can treat the body as a
fluid, and high-pressure situations are not new. Anyone have any figures?",3

": Oh bull pucky, Ed. They use dogs because a) Many people are

Exactly.  Although this may be a dissapointing answer, there has to be an
interplay of the two.  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.  A person's
self-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely
mental/verbal level, and don't usually find expression in society except in an
impure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.  Sometimes this has to be so.


Also, what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society, in a very
real sense?  To use the obvious example, there is a political society, and a
racial society, and a gender society, and sometimes they do not always agree on
every issue...



Yes.  Perhaps with an infamous ""do what you want so long as it doesn't hurt
others?""  The problem with this is that it is merely saying what you CAN do: it
is not a morality in that it doesn't propound any specifically preferred
behaviours.


I'll add a hearty ""me two"".  However, one could just as well say just because
certain actions are moral does not make them legal: one still doesn't really
get an impression of which one is truly ""right"".

This is a very good point. I have already made the clear claim that
Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur'an
and have given my arguments for this. This is something that can be
checked by anyone sufficiently interested. Khomeini, being dead,
really can't respond, but another poster who supports Khomeini has
responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. This should
be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist
modes of obfuscationism. 

So, to answer your question, the only way you can judge is by learning 
more about Islam, that is by reading the Qur'an and understanding it's 
basic principles. Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see 
who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at 
odds with Islam. Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve 
muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles 
of Islam, which is that no human being is metaphysically different than 
any other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical 
nature.

"John E. King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:

 * ""The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *
 *  treated as a matter of faith."" -- Francis Hitching                     *

  I have a few points to make about the above posting.

    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of ""quotes"" from either
    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)
    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive
    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike
    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to
    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests
    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they
    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a
    creationist and this may not be your real intent.

    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his
    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the
    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.
    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context
    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate
    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may
    not be your real intent.

    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of ""the modern theory of
    evolution"" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one
    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that
    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate
    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck
    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond
    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not
    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.

    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack
    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on
    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the
    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long
    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and
    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a
    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.


Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:

 * Neither I, nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *

  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster's B^).  Francis Hitchings
is a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the
part of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (""The Neck of
the Giraffe"").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)
using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could
not have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution
(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a ""non sequitur"" (i.e.
the conclusion ""does not follow""). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard
Lewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]

  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber
in the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was
titled ""`Giraffe' sticks scientific neck out too far"".  Excerpts include :

  ""Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.""  ""He goes after Darwin like Mark
  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and
  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.""  ""He suggests
  a mystical `organizing principle' of life, using the similarity of organs
  in different creatures as evidence [sic].""

  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not
against it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn't
surprise me much.  It's also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.
he only posted a quote).

If you had been looking in your mirror, you would have seen the guy coming 
before you heard the screeching tires.

When you're stopped at a light:

1)  Stop so that you're got space in front of you, and a quick easy escape
route (between lanes, into a crosswalk, up a driveway, somewhere) if someone
decides they want to plow into you.

2)  Keep the bike in first with the clutch in until at least a couple of cars
are stopped behind you, so you don't have to waste a second you don't have
trying to get it in gear if you need to move.

3)  Watch your mirrors.  In that situation, most of the hazards you are 
trying to avoid are coming from behind you.  SIPDE (<-- msf-geek-speak)
isn't just for when you're moving.  And you're less likely to panic and stall
the bike if you've got time to prepare before the guy's tires lock up behind
you.  (You still get the bejeezus scared out of you, but it's more a feeling
of quickly-rising dread than a sudden jolt.)

What atheists are you talking about?  

IMNSHO, Abortion is the womans choice.  Homosexual sex is the choice of 
the people involved.  War is sometimes necessary.  

This leaves capital punishment.  I oppose capital punishemnt because 
mistakes can happen (yes this thread went around with no resolution
recently).

As far as poplulation control, I think contraception and education are
the best courses of action.


That's because you are again making the assumption that all Atheists 
have some specific mindset.


Mistakes can happen Bill, and I could be the victim of such a mistake.

"In the last two weeks I have the following problem on two 160's

1 has a 8Mb Simm and the other a 6 Mb simm
Both are about 2 -3 months old, bought from different vendors and installed
by different people. 

Both computers begin crashing frequently, locking up and ultimately the
Memory Chimes.  Crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen
and sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer.  In
both cases, taking the machine apart, taking the memory out and putting it
back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback,  my
marginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger SIMMS are
""lopsided"" in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after
time they begin to move about - possible because of pressure on the
keyboard or something?  

Anyway, has anyone else had such a problem or solution - If somehow you
could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving.

I've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8Mb simm with a
2Mbsimm -although this is NOT desireble solution.

"The following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already,
but there are a number of items not seen here yet.....

Redesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign,
based on information provided by NASA headquarters.

The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the
Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The
day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics
covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for
the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the
assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management
options and operations concepts also were held.

The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:

¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest
said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has
identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended
and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed
to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable
capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified
Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing
systems such as the so-called ""Bus-1 spacecraft,"" the orbiter and Spacelab.

The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom
photo voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab
missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.

Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.
Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking
ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter
docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different
operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.

¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option
B activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,
from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent
Human Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent
Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the
baseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking
system, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data
Management System.

Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree
inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration
orbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic
arrays providing 18.75 kW of power.

Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss
segments and the U.S. lab.

Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two
orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.

Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other
section of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and
propulsion systems.

The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete
state with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,
a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete
the Permanent Human Capability with International stage.

Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware
would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived
option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including
program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and
operations costs, he said.

¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,
the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid
rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle
main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch
and jettisoned after ET separation.

The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000
cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 ""decks"" connected by a
centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various
places on the circumference of the module to place the international
modules, and other elements.  This ""can"" would have two fixed photo voltaic
arrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial
attitude.

In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connor
said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so
that detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the
Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.

Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space
experts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members
of the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space
Agency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. 
Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,
the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team
briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking
systems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the
Soyuz TM spacecraft.

The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities
of the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian
capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will
be available to the SRT through May 5.

Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT
subgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to
develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a
foundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various
management options have been developed including:

¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of
command.

The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the
Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had
already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its
preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.

As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency
experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of
assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing
and ground operations.

What's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a
comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday
and Tuesday at which point the design will be ""frozen"" to begin the
detailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing
for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to
be held May 3.

Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the
Station Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over the
activities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant
deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve
as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to
consult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request
from Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.

Key Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being
carried on the schedule are:

April 26
Design Freeze on Options for Costing

April 27
Design Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT

May 3
Status report to Redesign Advisory Committee

May 15
Interim report by Redesign Advisory Committee

June 7

I can produce similar artifacts.

I am using a Centris 610 with an Apple 16"" monitor.  I got the 8/230/CD
configuration, so there is on-board ethernet and 1 Megabyte of video ram.
The effect only occurs in 256 color and 256 grey modes.  Any vertical scrolling operation, whether with a scrollbar or, say, using vi and inserting lines,
will produce a scattering of horizontal flickering lines on the screen.
They do not persist -- each is visible for perhaps one refresh, and then
that part of the screen is back as usual.

They seem to always start at or about the 64th pixel from the left,
and are maybe 512 pixels wide.  This is certainly not preventing me from
using my Macintosh ;-), but it does seem to be a sign of something
perhaps grounded incorrectly in the video circuitry...


I went ahead and called the Apple Customer Assistance Center, at:
  1-800-776-2333, or 1-800-767-2775 (more direct?)

The person who answered was polite :-).  I also took the chance to complain
about my mouse button sticking, and about the mac hanging on boot after a
(hard - killed MacsBug) crash which left a CD in the drive.  (I had to play
with a paperclip for about 5 minutes to get thing to eject, after which the
mac booted fine.)",1

On a similar note, a good friend of mine worked as a clerk in a
chain bookstore.  Several of his peers were amazing, one woman in
particular:

A customer asked her if they had _The Autobiography of Benjamin
Franklin_.  ""Who's it by?"" was her first question.  Then, ""Is he
still alive?""  Then, ""Is it fiction or non-fiction?"" 

Finally my friend intervened, and showed the guy where it was.

Andrew,

The myth to which I refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have
created to make religion appear absurd. Rather than approach religion
(including Christainity) in a rational manner and debating its claims
-as the are stated-, atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then
hold the religious accountable for beliefs they don't have. What is
more accurately oxymoric is the a term like, reasonable atheist.

Here's a good example of of what I said above. Read the post again, I
said, ""Acoording to ..."", which means I am referring to Christian
doctrine (as I understand it), if I am speaking for myself you'll know
it. My purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of Christain
doctrines since it seemed germane.

Bill

Again I am paraphrasing Christian doctrine which is very clear on this
point, your dispute is not with me ...

Bill

: 2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.

: 3) Again, read the FAQ.

1) Here again you miss the point. The Bible itself is not the point,
it's what it contains. It makes no difference who accpets the Bible or
even who's unaware of its existence, Christians hold that it applies
universally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate
and the same innate knowledge of God.

2) See above

3) If you read my post with same care as read the FAQ, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

As I said, the evidence is there, you just don't accept it, here at

Yes, human reason does always come back to the existence of God, we're
having this discussion are we not?

driven most of the field to use radio, far infrared or space-based
telescopes. In any case, a bright point of light passing through
the field doesn't ruin observations. If that were the case, the
thousands of existing satellites would have already done so (satelliets
might not seem so bright to the eyes, but as far as astronomy is concerned,

This is historically incorrect.  Early Zionist 'fighters' did indeed
target civilians.  They made random attacks in Arab marketplaces,
killing innocent passers-by.  Your assertion of the opposite is an
attempt to whitewash history.  Anyone can read about the history of

Bell, an expert in international terrorism.  (His main interest is
Irish terrorism.)

Dirty Cosar pig has been doing just that for a long, long time.

Source: ""Ahmet Cosar said to have been part of 1992 Terror Attack at
MacDonalds in Munich,"" The Fuckersville Reporter, February 7, 1993, p. 1.

""Le Merde, the influential Anatolia daily, based on unidentified sources,
claimed last week that Ahmet Cosar, the founder and leader of one
faction of the Big Mac Funny Army for the Liberation of Flies from the
Spider Webs (BMFALFSW), was among the Argic led terrorists who staged an
attack on the toilets at MacDonalds fast food restaurant in Munich...

Le Merde added that up to 1992, Cosar operated out of tygra.michigan.com,
but escaped from the country when Bullshit bikers entered the city. It was
about this time that a statement issued by BMFALFSW claimed that Mr. Cosar
was dead of wounds suffered during a mailbombing by bdb@becker.gts.org,
although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and
well and presently is residing alternately in Fuckersville, Bullshitia, and
Zuma, Stupidia. The paper also noted that the communist government of
Sexual Maniac Hasan B. Mutlu and his F.U.C.K.A.L.L party accepted the
Zumabot's underground leader with ""open arms"" and still providing him
with assistance in exchange for pornographic material.

Le Merde further adds that BMFALFSW derives only a small portion of its
expenditures from wealthy drug lords who support the cause, with the rest 
coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in
child-porn trafficking.""

Do you know of the world-wide-web?  This is a global hypertext (well, 
hypermedia) network running on the internet.  One of the nice things
about it is that is understands and incorporates virtually all of the
other systems being used, like WAIS, Gopher, FTP, Archie, etc.  It
is usually quite easy to add existing resources to the web.

If you'd like to explore, I'd suggest getting the XMosaic program,
written at the NCSA.  It's an X-windows web browser, and is pretty
slick.  It can understand and cope with more than text: gif, jpeg, mpeg,
audio, etc.  There are other browsers, including a text-mode browser
for people stuck on a text terminal, but I'm most familliar with mosaic.

Under the page ""The World-Wide Web Virtual Library: Subject Catalogue""
(this is available under the Documents menu in mosaic, or by any
browser via the URL 
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html )
there is a subject ""Space Science.""  Currently this points to a
page under construction, with only the NASA JPL FTP archive.  I've
volunteered to take over this page, and in fact I have a replacement

It has nothing to do with how long they have been voting, as much as HOW
they have been voting.  Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals
for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order.  Correlate this
with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections.
Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas.

Lo and behold, you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members
did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of
Arab candidates.  This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts
between Israeli Arabs.  Some claim membership to right wing parties
while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff.

I worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections (not this
last one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that
were returned from the local delegates elected.  At the time, the system
was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there
was no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates.


Quite simply, if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor
party and voted, they would be able to command more than %15 of
the delegates.  This is a power base that can not be ignored!
Especially when they are not ranked high in the party (once again
due to lack of political power).  I have seen how the labor party
works from the inside and my experience has been that, as in most
political situations, the MKs act out of their own self-interest.

And to answer your question, I ""broke"" with labor because I felt
that they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodox
coalition members.


Fair enough.  My take on the matter, and I will admit to the possibility
that this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy argument.
If he was sitting on the committee, then someone else obviously would not
be.  In drumming up support for his seat, MK [?] would not be averse to
using this argument, or it could be used on his behalf.

As to the proof presented in this article, I would find it very
interesting to know who proposed the compromise along with a followup
describing how the matter stands/was resolved.

Let me just take this opportunity to say that I deplore such actions
and groundless justifications.


For the record, Roni Milo, is a brash MK (self described) from the Likud
(note NOT LABOR).  Quite frankly, I don't think anything he would say could
surprise me.  Annoy and aggravate, yes, surprise - no.


Yes I do and thank you for providing it.  I would be most interested
in knowing how things turned out.  Anyone......?

past 6 years (her own bikes), I've only been involved in one accident
which was caused by a cage driver running a stop sign, I currently own
a BMW R90, Michelle owns a Yamaha Virago 700, we prefer cruising over
racing, we've toured a fair amount, we're both licensed and insured,
and we're nice people.

So, if anyone has a bike (or bikes :-), but the second one would have
to be a Virago or something else with an equally low seat) that they
would be willing to loan us for 3-4 days in July, Michelle and I would
be eternally grateful. In addition to our friendship, you would also
have the use of our bikes should you ever pass through Minneapolis.
In exchange, we would be happy to take you and a guest out for dinner
and an evening of wild bike stories, or we might even be willing to
cough up some money for improvements to the bike(s), like new tires or
something.

Also, any information about bike rentals in the Boston area would be
greatly appreciated.",2

No, I spent a month just reading, too, mainly because I did not know
much about the way atheists think. I even printed out the FAQs and
discussed it with a friend before I started posting.

Alt.atheism deals with religious issues (more appropriately, lack of
religious beliefs), which are by their very nature very controversial.
It makes sense to read what is being discussed and how just to make

If we assume 6% inflation since 1969, that $25B would be worth about $100B
GD reckon a moon mission today could cost only $10B. Thats a factor of ten

Bosnian Muslims are citizens od Bosnia-Herzegovina who identify themselves
with Bosnian Muslim cultural and religious tradition.


In Bosnia, ""Muslim"" is not merely a religious category, but an ethnic
one as well.  Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments
made by people on this subject:

(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims
    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.

(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel
    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.

In 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,
and (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if
Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under
Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any
clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although
Bosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national
allegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and
historic identity.  So, arguments like ""yes, but your ancestors were
Croats or Serbs"" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what
their ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel
that they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.
What outsiders say is simply not relevant.


In the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when ""Muslim nationality""
appeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result
of a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing
""Bosniaks"" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)
declaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement 
of this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of
""Muslim nationality"" choice in census forms.

For comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories
available to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:

Serb-Muslims:                        71,991
Croat-Muslims:                       25,295
Muslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403

This clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own
nationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat
nationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have
consistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose ""undeclared"",
in 1953 they chose ""Yugoslavs"", in 1961 both ""Yugoslavs"" and ""Bosniak 
ethnic group"", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose ""Muslim nationality"".

Perhaps the term ""Bosnian Muslim nationality"" is too confusing for
the rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking
about Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some
separate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and
cultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,
because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political
fanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival
dominate people's thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,
Bosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime
as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.",4
"I guess I'm delving into a religious language area.  What exactly is morality

immoral?  Do we fall to what the basis of these morals are?

Also, consensus positions fall to a might makes right.  Or, as you brought out,
if whatever is right is what is societally mandated then whoever is in control
at the time makes what is right

Wrong, the CD300 (external) is just a plain ol' SCSI device.


No, multisession capability and double speed are two different thing.  Its just  
that the newer CD ROM drives have both capability.  Multisession means that  
when you put more pictures on a photo CD after the first session, the drive can  
read and display them.  Double speeds just transfer ANY type of data (excluding  
sound) at around double the speed.

 
CD150 is not multisession capable.  This means that you lose the ability to add

Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this

Pat, this would be slower, more expensive and worse.  

Slower:  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December.  That's less
than eight months away.  There is no way you could build new hardware, retrain
and reschedule the EVA's in that time.

More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it
was going to do execpt fire the OMS.  In addition, you've added significant
extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.


According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there are
only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST and
AXAF.  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle,
there doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle.

You don't get it - do you? During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet 
Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the 
Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, 
but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. 
To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. 
In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish 
homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet 
Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:

1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility.

2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism 
Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish 
Genocide.

3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through
the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to 
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.

4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters
of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.

Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government 
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.

Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its 
terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks 
to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically 
exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on 
this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of 
governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition 
of the Turkish Genocide.

With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial
demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people
will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims
of the Turkish Genocide demand:

1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian 
Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;

2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people;

3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for 
their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;

4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially
recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse
to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;

5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it 
has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially 
recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be 
supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;

6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact 
of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 
2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.

Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The ""large""
grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with
fair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the
thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating
efficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long
wavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate
the energy they have absorbed.

Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100
microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer
wavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In
the extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable
by any conceivable observation.

Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a
population of ""small"" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50
atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to
temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool
quickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_
the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small
population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed
""average"" temperature.

A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has
three components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal
dust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust
(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At
the ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are
respectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly
doubled in the ecliptic plane.

To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution
factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then
take the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from
Allen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent
to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work
could do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a
dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be
cooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of
starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave
background, and I believe that to be correct.)

[PTS]       --------------------------------------------------------
[PTS]                            By Alec Rasizade

[PTS] 

[AR] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno (Upper) Karabakh
[AR] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western
[AR] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established
[AR] Armenian-American community.  Azeri views on this dispute have
[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me
[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the
[AR] origins of the conflict.

During the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,
a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.

The following should be interesting. 

[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and
[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,
[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian
[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,
[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,
[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait
[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.

This not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an
independent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September
1991, page 28, we read:

 ""By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in
  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party
  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to
  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were
  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 
  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...""

  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in
  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.""

In this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian 
pogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!

[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that
[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule
[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of ""divide and
[AR] rule.""  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year
[AR] history of the conflict.

It is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the
perpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.
 
[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in
[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an
[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in
[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian
[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.

Incorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an
agreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-
Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.
 
[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri
[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and
[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the
[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly
[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly
[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.
 
It's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the 
Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian
culture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The
Azeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and
play dead. 

[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country
[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the
[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish
[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government
[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and
[AR] possessions?

The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they
attempted to deprive Armenians of ""lands, homes, and possessions"".
 
[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.
[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian
[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,
[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.

True, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!
 
[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.
[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western
[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security
[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led
[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed
[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the
[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.
[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.

Western interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into
this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of 
Europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!
Dr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would
have us believe.
 
[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an
[AR]""Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.""  The truth is that the Armenians
[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.

Incorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish
claim. 

Armenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as ""Artsakh"", which 
comes from the Urartian term ""Urtekhe-Urtekhini"". NO Azeris yet! 

Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as ""Orkhistena"". NO Azeris yet!

In the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid
Armenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!

From the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom
of Ervan. NO Azeris yet!

Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or 
Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!

After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 
A.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!

End of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the 
Aranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!

By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!

Emperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen ""To
Armenia"". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!

In the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area
was stated as 11,000.

It was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central
Asia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence
in the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!

In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some 
Muslims in Karabakh!

In 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188
priests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian
percentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --
assuming no Kurds!

Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:

 ""The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the
  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings
  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between
  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and
  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis
  Republic.

  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet
  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!

				Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan
							N. Narimanov

				People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs
							Guseinov""

[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their
[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian
[AR] rule. 

No, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule
in the Caucasus, including Karabakh!

[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew
[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How
[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in
[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and
[AR] demanded separation from California?

Non-sequitur. 
 
[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement
[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.

Armenian historians don't say this!

[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the
[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and
[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.

Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and
their utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an 
argument totally invalid!

[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to
[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,
[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.

Wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-
political advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,
Azeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their
minorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other
nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.

[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the
[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the
[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual
[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This
[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the
[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory
[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.

Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of
Armenians.
 
[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the
[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the
[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the
[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.

Fine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian
enclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory
is the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local
population! 
 
[AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should
[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as
[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the
[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can
[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri
[AR] conflict from growing and spreading.
 
Azerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their
own future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are 
actions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war
in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as
an act of Allied aggression!

[AR] of Azerbaijan, is a visiting researcher at the Harriman Institute of
[AR] Columbia University in New York.

The above explained propaganda which certainly has nothing to do with 
the true facts is also today the main source of ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists'
illegal activities that still try to make money out of the bodies of 
the innocent victims of the Turkish genocide.

The criminal acts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government come directly
under the scope of the Convention on Genocide adopted by the General 
Assembly of the United Nations on December 8, 1948, containing the 
following provisions:

The Contracting Parties, having considered the declaration made 
by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution
95 (1) dated December 11, 1946, that genocide is a crime under
international law, contrary to the spirit and aims of the United
Nations and condemned by the civilized world;

Recognizing that in all periods of history genocide has inflicted
great losses on humanity; and

Being convinced that, in order to liberate mankind from such odious
scourge, international cooperation is required;

Members agree as hereinafter provided:

Article 1. The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether
committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under 
international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.

Article 2. In the present Convention genocide means any of the
following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or
in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as 
such:

A) Killing member of the group;
B) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
C) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life 
   calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole 
   or in part;
D) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
E) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group;

Article 3. The following acts shall be punishable:

a) Genocide
b) Conspiracy to commit genocide
c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide
d) Attempt to commit genocide.

Article 4. Persons committing genocide or any of the other acts
enumerated in Article 3 shall be punished, whether they are
constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private
individuals.

Had the Convention on Genocide existed before the Armenian 
massacres of the Turks and Kurds, it would probably have been 
difficult for the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its responsibles
to start murdering of civilian, defenseless, faithful Ottoman
citizens, children and women, (GENOCIDE AND ATTEMPT TO GENOCIDE),
to make plans to exterminate, as they have done also to Urartus
and Jews, faithful Ottoman citizens (CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT GENOCIDE), 
to incite Armenians to armed revolt against the legal authority
and to commit Genocide, (DIRECT AND PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO COMMIT
GENOCIDE).

Yes, and one thing to think about is the pricing on the 160M harddrive 
configuration.  When I got my lowly classic II, the options were 40 or 80M
harddrives, and it was clear that buying another 40M of harddrive space 
would cost *much* more than the difference in price between the two config-
uartions.  There is an analogous break in the LCIII/80 and 160 prices, and 
you will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive.  

Particularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up a
several-MB (up to 30!) partition, or if you are generating large files 
with DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix-like 
os, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful.  when you are 
pricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how much
it would cost you to add more storage down the road... (Might be a 
useful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, though
I must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my 
computer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to 
because I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, 
softPC or trying any unix os!)",1

I've only debated this issue twice in a.a, and occasionally in t.a.  The
first was in response to Simon Clippingdale's positive assertion that
disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals
are relative.  It doesn't.   Now, Simon has dropped out of the debate

Usually, one does.  Usually you're clear, but sometimes you aren't

and I feel that I'm debating against line noise.  Sometimes I get tired, and 
sometimes I have other things I'd rather do.  Again, this is USENET, and
life is tough all over.  You're going to have to deal with it.

#
#That's supposed to be a threat?

No, that's a simple statement, and an assertion that I am not answerable
to those who offer me baseless insults.  For example, those who accuse me 
of lying about my personal beliefs, while also complaining that I don't answer
their questions.  

#>#Like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there.

I have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided an
argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the
only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered
by some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about
fuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It's a good point, and I'm thinking
about it.
# 
#Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know,
#therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that
#these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process,
#restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject
#of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological
#claim, you have to prove it.

Nonsense.  My ""trick"" is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so 
does almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore 
that A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that we
can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, and
that the resulting system of values is self-consistent.

Now get this:  ""really is better"" is an idealisation, a fictional model,
in the same sense that ""real material existence"" is a fictional model. It
may or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful
_assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist 
""trick"", to wit:

I feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested person
I ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B,
or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B,
then it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothing
more can be said.  

I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority
seeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to
maximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that 
a supermajority's carefully considered morality would be better than the 
terrorist's - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical
relativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is
simply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival
anything in the world of religion.

#>#For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not
#>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by
#>#others.
#>
#>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively
#>wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this
#>is possible.  It is neither evidence for subjectivism, nor evidence
#>against objectivism (except sometimes, in a pragmatic sense).
#>
#It serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to
#judgements is absolute. And as long as you don't provide evidence for
#that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to
#believe your hypothesis.

I've done this: freedom, with the proviso that I still have to 
answer jon's objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no
objective meaning.

#Further, in order to make morality absolute, universal, or objective,
#you would have to show that it is independent of humans, or the attributes
#above look quite misleading.

Not really.  What evidence is there that _anything_ exists independently
of humans?  You'll be hard pressed to find any that isn't logically
equivalent when applied to values.

#>An analogous set of premises would be:
#>
#>Premise 1:  Some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest
#>            route  from my house to a bar is through the main entrance
#>            of the estate, and down the Malahide road.
#>
#>Premise 2:  I checked it out, and found that the shortest route from my
#>            which is much closer.
#>
#>You would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my
#>house to a bar; yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim,
#>using premises which are logically no different.
#>
# 
#No. Morals are a matter of belief so far. The people still believe that the
#shortest way is through the main entrance. No agreement on *belief* here.
#And in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a
#shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it
#is the shortest way indeed. In other words,  your analogy works only when
#one assumes that your  premises are right in the first place. If not, it is
#a fallacy.

And if this were an argument for objectivism, you'd be right.  It isn't,
though, it's a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument
*against* objectivism, nor argument *for* relativism.  Your gimmick is to
assume in the first place that values aren't real, and to use this to ""prove""
that values aren't real.  In other words, you beg the question against me.

Doesn't sound like they attended, though, does it?  In fact, if we riders
need friends, it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from 
Lynn's description, especially if the same crowd gets invited back
to party some more year after year.


You seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these ""lesser
indiscretions"".  If the towns-people aren't ruffled by the
""indiscretions"" and the partyers aren't either, maybe the ""indiscretions""
don't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless 
good-natured rowdiness among consenting adults.  The only thing that 
really bothered me about the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans 
in the street, but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they 
helped set up the party in the first place.  If I lived there and the
bikers' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation
and good intentions, I'd certainly rather they stick around and party
than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed.


If it doesn't hurt anyone, and all the parties to the party benefit
and consider the entire activity to be benign and harmless, then who 
needs to ""permit"" or ""justify"" it?  You?  Why do *you* need to do that?


Ironically, these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that
don't happen to fit the stereotype you describe.  They've developed a
friendly long-term mutually-beneficial relationship with a group of 
motorcyclists, and aren't as burdened with MC-ignorance as is the general
population because of it.

this has merit but is not entirely true.

this last statement is not true.  According to the CBO the United States
has a force of about 88,000 US Army personel in Europe, I do not know
if this includes a USMC division in Norway.  They have available
a little more than 500 USAF attack aircraft, including various models
of the F-111, A-10, F-19A/B,  and a few F-4s. {there are about 1,000
more of these available, SAFELY TUCKED AWAY AT HOME. At one time, the
US maintained 1500 MBTs {about half were M1A1} but some of these were
relocated to the Persian Gulf.  I know the US has at LEAST one 
aircraft carrier battle group nearby and probably a marine assault
brigade.  Does anyone know if there are any B-52/B-1Bs in England?

The point is, although there are no US ground troops in Bosnia,
it is not true that that all the american forces are safely camped
outside of St. Louis.    

I also understand that the administration is planning to position
troops in Macedonia.  Any reaction out there to this?

Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on
the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes
showing
the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so
newspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there
would
appear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how
dramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the
situation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued
throughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central
spotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman's
right to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it's
interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,
some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued
to be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these

groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of 
hate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard 
was annoying.)

Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at
""organized""
Islam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam
which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a ""secular"" Islam - an Islam
separated from it's Qur'an, it's Prophet, God, its legislation, and most
importantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie
made
his views known - the Muslim's made their anger at his book known. The
scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this
time,
already a political situation - affecting governments as well as
individuals.
The situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.
At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -
engaged
in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.

Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as

this has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any
kind, has no
obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till
matters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in ""boldly""
defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary
work, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as
a kind of secular ""heroic Knight"",mounted on the his media steed,
 doing battle with the ""dragon"" of Islamic ""fundamentalism"".

Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who 
grew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim's hold dear, 
who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions
to slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -
who, when
faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with
his mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were
injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,
continued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.
Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief
making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths
of Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischief
even after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to
decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the
centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the
continuing mischief - all media support, government support was
just that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who
were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy
to see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that
deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief
making, was applied to Rushdie.


I have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. ""Image"" is
the chief concern of Muslim 'apologists' for Islam and for Rushdie.
If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture
within a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws
had precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam
would then be thought to have a good ""image"" (Principally because it would
by and large reflect the secular image). A ""good image"" usually means "" be
more
like me"".

Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude
that
resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.

So, the Greek educational system is also in a shambles. History shows 
that within the last 170 years, Greeks played that game twice: They 
used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in 1822 to instigate the Morea 
rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the Muslim people. Again, 
the Orthodox Patriarch Constantine V invited the Russian Czar Nicholas 
II to invade the Ottoman Empire 'in the name of Jesus,' and save his 
flock from Ottoman rule.

p. 161.

In the words of Professor Skiotis, ""With savage jubilance, [the Greeks]
sang the words 'Let no Turk remain in the Morea, nor in the whole world.'
The Greeks were determined to achieve to 'Romaiko' in the only way they
knew how: through a war of religious extermination.""

Let me further improve this one for you. After the Ottoman Empire lost 
World War I, the British landed in 1919 a 200,000 Greek army in Izmir 
to exterminate the people of Turkiye. Are you suffering from a severe 
case of amnesia? The tired and defeated Turks rose up, formed a National 
Force under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, and on August 30, 1922 they 
annihilated the bulk of the Greek Army.

Now wait, there is more.

  <<The Greek War of Independence brought disaster to the Jewish communities
  in the Peloponnesos, where the revolution erupted in 1821. The Jews,
  because of their close association with the Ottoman administration,
  were massacred along with the Turks. The Jewish communities of Mistras,
  Tripolis, and Kalamata were decimated; the few survivors moved north to
  settle in Chalkis and Volos, still under Ottoman rule. Patras lost its
  ancient Jewish community, which was refounded only in 1905.>>

  <<...the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire which had been going on
  for a century was disastrous for Ottoman Jewry. This was the age of
  nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan, starting with
  the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century, which, based on
  the Megali Idea, or Great Idea, sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul
  and large portions of Anatolia, union of which with Greece was felt to be
  the 'dream and hope of all'. The success of the Greek national movement,
  provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the
  efforts of the Greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the
  other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed, not so
  much by the Ottomans but, rather, by the Greek religious hierarchy which
  dominated the Orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious
  independence, granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870, to the
  Serbian Church in 1879, and to the Rumanian Church in 1885, with subsequent
  aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>>

  page 188:

  <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their
   campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular
   representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian
   missionaries, who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and
   hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as
   ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence.

   Christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity,
   soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews
   and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past.
   Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed, involving
   large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies,
   by the independent states that resulted, also by Christian subjects
   who remained within the Empire, particularly because of Jewish and Muslim
   support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent
   nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive
   and damaging.

   The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting
   nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian
   states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout
   the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary
   in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>>

  page 188:

  <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence,
   their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and
   massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking
   boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which
   had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries
   earlier.

   This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth
   century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united
   Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth
   century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its
   Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When
   Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian
   principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre
   of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>>

  page 189:

  <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. When the
  Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from
  Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and
  plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through
  Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece.>>

  page 190 (second paragraph):

  <<When Venice occupied the island of Chios in 1694, its Jewish population
   was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal
   property was stolen by the native Greek population, leaving those Jews
   who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to
   compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce.>>

  page 190 (third paragraph):

  <<Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly
   because of their support for Ottoman rule. When the Greek nationalist
   movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia
   during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by
   the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During
   the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred
   in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about
   twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were
   massacred along with uncounted Turks [16].  Reverend John Hartley,
   after describing the carnage, concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled
   with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac
   and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the
   Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the
   city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial
   superior to that of an ass.' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of
   Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of
   Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18].
   The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled
   from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity
   under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into
   rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before
   it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression
   and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities
   to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years
   of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the
   mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the
   Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately
   fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary
   accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying
   exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of
   the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats
   to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman
   Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece,
   particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the
   Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their
   populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th
   century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews
   who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu
   and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands
   more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and
   Izmir [21].>>

   page 193 (last paragraph):

   <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing
   protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe
   stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all
   the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being
   used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as
   for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and
   professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian
   millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians,
   Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the
   Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally
   atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their
   homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors
   fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements
   subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done
   in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the
   twentieth century.>>

  page 194 (last paragraph):

  <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the
   Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the
   Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due
   to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of
   those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a
   popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of
   the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903,
   thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms
   in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods
   of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from
   persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria.

   The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian
   forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu,
   and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues,
   homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus
   toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically
   described the situation caused by the invading armies:

      'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe,
      all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never
      destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the
      entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can
      never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the
      damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done
      to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government
      weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors
      inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. The
      consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims, but sixty of
      them were massacred in a single night....'[28]

     'It wasn't only irregulars (Comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and
      burned. The soldiers of the Army, the Chief of Police, and the high
      civil officials took an active part in the events at Serres. Out of
      6,000 houses, 4,000 were burned. Almost 1,200 shops were consumed by
      flames and destructive bombs. The (Jewish) population lost all, and
      without even anything to wear is in despair. Everyone wants to
      emigrate...'[29]


  page 196:

    <<As a result of these assaults, massacres, and forced deportations from
   the independent countries of Southeastern Europe, the Ottoman Empire
   received literally thousands of Jewish refugees who joined the Muslims
   who survived the persecution, flooding into the Empire...>>

Perhaps you have a different understanding of what ""physics"" is.  If we
can't measure anything objectively, then the answers we get from physics
aren't objective either.  That's what I mean when I say there's no objective
physics.

Sure, we can all agree that (say) F = GMm/r^2, but that's maths.  It's only
physics when you relate it to the real world, and if we can't do that
objectively, we're stuck.  (Of course, this displays my blatant bias towards
applied science; but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real
world situations, based on real world observations.)


It's an axiom that it's invariant.  But if the two of us measure it, we'll
get different answers.  Yes, we call that experimental error, but it's not
really ""error"" in the conventional sense; in fact, if you don't get any,
that's an error :-)

You could argue that the value of c is ""objective, to within +/- <some
value>"".  But I'd call that a rather odd usage of the word ""objective"", and
it opens the way for statements like ""Murder is objectively wrong for all
people, to within 1% of the total population.""

"I've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent 
experience passengering with Dave Edmondson at pilot while in London. 

I found that it upset the bike much less if I rode with the pilot, that
is, if I looked over his shoulder and anticipated when I should hold on
hard for braking or acceleration. I tried to always look over the
inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible, leaving
Dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and 
luggage.

Hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit 
off the back is hard to fight. Similarly, I held on to the grab handles
tightly when Dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp (I'm
a lot bigger than he is...). Reaching around him and pushing off the 
tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for 
him to manage.

On the rare occasions when I carry a passenger myself, I absolutely
refuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding. That's
helmet, jacket, gloves, stout pants and shoes/boots as a minimum. It's 
not my responsibility to provide this gear, but it's my responsibility
to require it if they want to ride.

And I agree with an earlier poster: if you've not had much experience
carrying a particular passenger and especially if you've not carried
many passengers before, take a few gentler rides of some duration before
you head off to a difficult road like Mines/Mt. Hamilton. That's a

        I don't mean to sound disrespectful, but since the majority
of the contributors (and may be even readers) of this newsgroup seem
to be muslims, christians and jews, my question could be of some 
interest to any of them.
        It's my impression that both Islam and Christianity pay great
respect to an obscure 1st century jewish lad from Judea/Galilee. Why 
they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery
to me (personally, I prefer Woody Allen - his stories are much juicier)
- but perhaps it's an accident of history.
        Anyway, it seems that they may be talking about two different
jews. According to the New Testament his father's name was Joseph,
while in Qur'an he appears as Zachariah.  
        Who's right and why the name difference? I'm really curious.

Here you give positive, accurate ""facts"" about what happened to the beduins
and the land:

   After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev
   Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The
   10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of
   40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150
   mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out
   of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,
   spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin
   shepherds from roaming.

   A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.
   But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these
   Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure
   was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields
   in order that the land could be transferred to the army.

And now you say noone knows anything about what happened there:

   No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held
   today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of
   the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized
   by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now
   confined to seven ""development towns"", or *sowetos*, established
   for them.

   (the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:
   elias@ismennt.is)

So what you basically say is that ""we know for sure that nothing good happens
there now,  we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived
and that they were driven away by the Jews,  noone on earth knows about
what the Jews did there.""

Is that what you said?  Could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote?

BTW,  try asking beduins in Sinai how they mis the Israelis.  Not to mention
that there are enough valotaring beduins in the IDF to have at least one full
brigade of them.

One performance reason comes to mind: if you jettison the SSME's, you
don't have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization
burn(s).  On-orbit, SSME's are just dead weight, since we don't have an
SSME H2/O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-G.  This means
that you can't use them for re-boost or anything else.  Dead weight has
a couple of advantages, but more disadvantages.

Throw-away SSME's might let us use some of the old SSME's which are not-
quite-man-ratable.  But I doubt we'd do that; the cost of a launch
failure is too high.

"We`ve had the the Great Western, the [ dunno ] and the Great Northern
postulated as Brunel`s masterpiece. Keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll
get round to it eventually.

The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship,
with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which broke
the 'Little Giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap
forward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with
primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean
going vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo
and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose
with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles
without coaling.

Unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time,
and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another poster
said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable
laying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying
a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to
carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for
defective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book ""How the World was One""
[ I think that`s right ]

If that`s how the Shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumph
and a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirely
ignoble, but I doubt if history will be so charitable.  Its true the
Shuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are they
worth doing? With low cost access to space, you could have an
affordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended manned
missions. As it is, the shuttle is not so much a space-truck as a
space-RV, ( only not so cheap to run :-( )",3

	Israel very often gets away with more
than most other nations (Due to U.S. vetos). While I am not
familiar with every instance I know that the reason Saudi
Arabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the
pilgrims were iranian. Yes, the UN is biased but mostly in
favor of the US and its allies (Including Israel, Saudi Arabia
and Pakistan) and against ""Outlaw"" countries like iran and more
recently Iraq. Far be it from me to support the repressive
governments there but I think they get more slack than Israel
for things they do ""wrong"". Again the reason some condemnations
don't occur lies in the race or country of the victims. The
gassed Iraqi kurds got associated with Iran in the war and
since Iran was perceived as worse than Iraq no condemnation
resulted. The palestinians killed by arab countries involved
another case of who cares. It seems that until very recently no
one cared about how many palestinians died anywhere (including
in Israel and the occupied territories).

    The double standard of human behavior regarding the Jews must
    be manitained.

    A perfect example is the outcry over the temporary removal of
    400 men who advocated murdering Jews and destroying the State
    of Israel, compared to the deafening silence over the abusive
    treatment of Jews in Arab countries during the past 50 years.

    Compare the tacit appoval that the world gives to Muslims who
    randomly murder Jewish civilians to the righteous indignation
    expressed if people in the occupied territories are kept from
    working in Israel in an effort to reduce these random murders
    from occuring, while everyone knows that no country is at all
    required to accept foreign workers, except Israel, of course.

    Jewish blood has always been cheap.  The non-Jewish world ha
    never regarded any form of Jewish suffering important, except
    when the Jews were the models of the powerless victim holding
    the high moral ground, as it had been just after World War 2.  
    However, as soon as the Jewish people started to take care of 
    themselves, the ancient hatred of Jews was unleashed again.  
    
    I doubt if the non-Jewish world is even capable of having any
    compassion towards Jews as anti-semitism is so ancient and so
    basic to both Christianity and Islam.  
    
    Golda Meir said that there would be peace when the Arabs love
    their own children more than they hate the Jews.  And while I
    know that there are more Arab parents who love their children 
    than those who would send their children out into the streets 
    to throw rocks at men trained to defend themselves with guns,
    the world is so obsessed by a hatred of Jews trying to defend 
    themselves that they have yet to even question the actions of 
    those parents who not simply allow their children to do this, 
    but encourage them to throw themselves into harm's way.  Even 
    Arab children are expendable, if their tragic deaths are used 
    in the neverending propoganda battle to blame Israel, and the  
    Jews, for any misfortune befalling Arabs in the middle east.

   port.  As far as I can see (it being somewhat ""hole of Calcutta"" at the
   time!), the nuts are still there  (stop that bloody sniggering, you  at
   the back!), but the pipe is a bit loose.

   This morning  I go  out to  the bike  and pull  out the  socket-set  to

   come to work (late again!) so that I  can ask of the oracle...  Will  a
   brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port?  Anybody tried it?

If this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve, I have
the same question.  Do you buy a FULL set of shims before starting the
adjustment process, or do you calculate the shims you need and then run
off to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock? 
Obviously the latter would be cheaper (what do shims cost?), but are
measurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims?

You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost,
and you don't want to clip off the panels each time.

For the Gamma-Ray Observatory, one of the design requirements was that
there be no stored-energy mecahnisms (springs, explosive squibs, gas shocks,
etc.) used for deployment.  This was partially so that everything could
be reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay, and partially for
safety considerations.  (I've heard that the wings on a cruise missile
would cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they opened.)

Back when the shuttle would be going up every other day with a cost to
orbit of $3.95 per pound :-), everybody designed things for easy servicing.

OK. Tell me how many people in Zionist movements define a Jew in a 
different way, and how many are who define Jew based on a religious way.


You need to start reading before answering. 
My point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic, it 
does not mean that I consider it to be nationalistic. I did not comapre
Israel to the IRA. I think that you are starting to put words on my

say you do ot believe me.



Why don't you try reading for a change? Did I say that the Law of Return
demand a person to be religious? Now, how does the Law of Return define 
who is a Jew and who is not? I said that it uses a religious standard:
If your mother is a Jew, you are a Jew, if your mother is not Jewish,
neither you are.

a) F and M are both Jewish.
b) F is Jewsh and M is not.
c) F is Muslim and M is jewish.
d) F is Christian and M is Jewish.
e) F and M are both non-Jewish.




It called history. At some point it was OK. Now, I believe, it is not.

said that someone in this net is guilty of it. It was just an example. Nothing
more, nothing less than that. Why did you have to clarify what you think?

Third, we can exchange ideas if you want, but you come out with this nonsense
about being believable = using the definitions given in a dictionary.

	   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)
	   
	Socket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as
	   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins
	   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.

	Cooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a 
	   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had
	   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which
	   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up 
	   something similar or risk frying your CPU.
	   
Procedure

1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.

2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from
	the back of the mac.
 
3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release.
 
4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it.
                                            
5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A
    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop
    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here.

7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic
    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,
	rear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.
	
9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to
    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.
	
10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of
    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic
	Power light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The
	motherboard then comes directly out.
	
11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the
    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators
	must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.
	
	Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of
	the pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure
	your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.
	
	I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is
	NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is
	a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without
	proper care.
	
12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.

13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the
	old clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the
	socket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new
	50 mhz clock.
	
14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.
	
14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.

15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother
    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.
	
16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place.
	
17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE.

18) Replace the phillips head screw

19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.

21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn 
    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,
	something is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your
	handiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.
	
	Hopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and
	replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and
	be astounded. 
	
	You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding
	a particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up
	might take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since
	modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single
	problem.
	
Good Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real
risk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than
$50 in parts.",1

                               Books -- Fiction

THOMAS M. DISCH

""The Santa Claus Compromise""
Short story.  The ultimate proof that Santa exists.  All characters and 
events are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well...

WALTER M. MILLER, JR

""A Canticle for Leibowitz""
One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives
copying blueprints from ""Saint Leibowitz"", filling the sheets of paper with
ink and leaving white lines and letters.

EDGAR PANGBORN

""Davy""
Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example,
forbids that anyone ""produce, describe or use any substance containing...
atoms"". 

PHILIP K. DICK

Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short 
stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.
He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than
technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he
remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:

""Galactic Pot-Healer""
A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is
unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.

""A Maze of Death""
Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.

""VALIS""
The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic
Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of
unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and
dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.

""The Divine Invasion""
God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from
another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be
assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.

MARGARET ATWOOD

""The Handmaid's Tale""
A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously
assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it
""right"" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live
under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,
and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the
radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished
retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the ""old world"" are
hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to
at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.

VARIOUS AUTHORS

""The Bible""
This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it
is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is
about.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one
true version.

                             Books -- Non-fiction

PETER DE ROSA

""Vicars of Christ"", Bantam Press, 1988
Although de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very
enlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.
(German translation: ""Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums"",
Droemer-Knaur, 1989)

MICHAEL MARTIN

""Atheism: A Philosophical Justification"", Temple University Press,
 Philadelphia, USA.
A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding
appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious
area.  Argues both for ""negative atheism"" (i.e. the ""non-belief in the
existence of god(s)"") and also for ""positive atheism"" (""the belief in the
non-existence of god(s)"").  Includes great refutations of the most
challenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting
contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.
541 pages. ISBN 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available)

""The Case Against Christianity"", Temple University Press
A comprehensive critique of Christianity, in which he considers
the best contemporary defences of Christianity and (ultimately)
demonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent.
273 pages. ISBN 0-87722-767-5

JAMES TURNER

""Without God, Without Creed"", The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,
 MD, USA
Subtitled ""The Origins of Unbelief in America"".  Examines the way in which
unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative
world-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France
and Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England
developments.  ""Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,
Without God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate
of a single idea, the belief that God exists."" 
316 pages. ISBN (hardcover) 0-8018-2494-X (paper) 0-8018-3407-4

GEORGE SELDES (Editor)

""The great thoughts"", Ballantine Books, New York, USA
A ""dictionary of quotations"" of a different kind, concentrating on statements
and writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the person's philosophy
and world-view.  Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many
people.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various
people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of
the quotations are derived from Cardiff's ""What Great Men Think of Religion""
and Noyes' ""Views of Religion"".
490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.

RICHARD SWINBURNE

""The Existence of God (Revised Edition)"", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford
This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with ""The Coherence of
Theism"" (1977) and was concluded with ""Faith and Reason"" (1981).  In this
work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the
existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely
upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and
aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were
decisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".  In the revised
edition of ""The Existence of God"", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.

J. L. MACKIE

""The Miracle of Theism"", Oxford
This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal
arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical
philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through
the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements
of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those
positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,
such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements for
God"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less
formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct
when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.

JAMES A. HAUGHT

""Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History of Religious Murder and Madness"",
 Prometheus Books
Looks at religious persecution from ancient times to the present day -- and
not only by Christians.
Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 89-64079. 1990.

NORM R. ALLEN, JR.

""African American Humanism: an Anthology""
See the listing for African Americans for Humanism above.

GORDON STEIN

""An Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism"", Prometheus Books
An anthology covering a wide range of subjects, including 'The Devil, Evil
and Morality' and 'The History of Freethought'.  Comprehensive bibliography.

EDMUND D. COHEN

""The Mind of The Bible-Believer"", Prometheus Books
A study of why people become Christian fundamentalists, and what effect it
has on them.

GEORGE H. SMITH

""Atheism: The Case Against God"", Prometheus Books
Describes the positions of atheism, theism and agnosticism.  Reviews many 
of the arguments used in favour of the existence of God.  Concludes with an
assessment of the impact of God on people's lives.

no its not.

its due to the fact that there are two issues here: Religion and religion.

religion is personal belief system.
Religion is a memetic virus.

people loudly proclaiming their beliefs are crossing the border from
religion -> Religion.  people that want to ""save"" others are firmly
entrenched in Religion (""memoids"").

rule #1 of not practicing Religion is to shut the fuck up, unless
you discuss it politely.  this means that the motive behind the conversation
is not only your self-gratifying wish to spread the word.  

religion is something that ultimately comes from within a person, and
reflects their value judgements.  Religion is something that is
contracted from others and does not reflect the persons value judgements
(other than perhaps ""i think i'll be brainwashed today"").

Religion is a drug...

i believe you can discuss religion.  however, the post that started this
off was not intented as discussion, it was more a proclamation of
someones Religion.",0
"since at least one other person was interested in this:

my FZR's black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired.
yesterday i bought a can of VHT 1500 degree black header paint and spent an
hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand.  sprayed on paint.  thought
about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that
i wouldn't be at all suprised if the paint wore/chipped off in a month.

soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder
coating, while extremely durable, will not handle over ~600 degree
temperatures.  the place i talked to said they were experimenting with
some new powder that is supposed to handle 1100 degrees but that it wouldn't
be available for months at least.  they directed me to another shop that
specializes in header coating.

the other shop said they have 2 coatings available.  one is aluminized that
can do 1200+ degrees and is ""comparable"" to powder coating for durability.
the other is silicon (i think) based and can do 1800+ degrees (!) but is
thinner and not as durable.  both coatings have a textured finish (not
super smooth) and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush.

price for 4 1-foot header pipes and a 2-foot 4-2-1 collector was ~$100.  i'm
planning to take the parts up friday and get them back (UPS) next week maybe
wednesday.

sounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint
considering how much abuse the pipes get from road crap/rocks.",2

My information shows that the last San Marco launch was 1988.  There seem to 
have been a total of seven before that.  I seem to recall that someone, either
ASI or the University of Rome (?) includes money in their annual budget for
maintainance of the platforms (there are actually two).

The Italians have been spending money to develop an advanced Scout.  However,
recent events in the Italian space program, and the Italian government overall
make me skeptical that this will get off the ground in the near future.",3

"Excerpts from netnews.talk.politics.mideast: 16-May-93 Re: Saudi
clergy   condemns d.. Robertc. Moldenhauer@par (2149) 

  The whole ""saddam is going to invade Saudi Arabia"" was nothing but US State 
  Department propeganda.  Saddam (and Iraq in general) never recognised the 
  British created Kuwait.  

This is complete garbage.   It is Kuwait FAQ number 1 (maintained, but
not compiled, by me to rebut the leftist drivel frequently posted wrt
Kuwait): 

------------------------------------------------------------ 

First is a note on the bogus arguments that the British 
drew the maps to deprive Iraq of Oil. Then follows a 
chronology of events in Kuwait's history.   Following 
the chronology is a speech by the Kuwaiti ambassador 
to the U.N.. Following this is an article on the origins 
of Kuwait. Following this is a series of articles 
which attest to the fact that Kuwait was independent of both 
(non-existent) Iraq and the Ottoman Empire. 

--- 

The Iraqi regime claims that Kuwait was cut from Iraq by the British 
in order to deprive Iraq of its oil. The 1913 and 1932 border treaties 
between Kuwait and Iraq represent clear testimonies against such an 
allegation since oil was discovered in Kuwait in 1938!

Shedding Some Light 

On September 29 1990, the National Council on US-Arab Relations 
invited the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the United States, Saud Nasser 
Al-Sabah. The following are quotes of his speech: 

``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before 
Iraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in 
existence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the 
conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the 
area. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective 
agreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security 
of Kuwait.'' 

``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining 
without any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an 
agreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government 
and the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, 
after Kuwait itself.'' 

``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the 
opportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The 
British came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty 
and territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again 
signed border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq's 
recognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.''

Origins of Kuwait 

The establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the 
Bani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of 
Kuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go 
further up to 1611. Kuwait's name is derived from al-Kut which means 
fortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a 
horn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its 
establishment. 

The 'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of 'Utub, settled in Kuwait 
during the early 18th century. They lived under the protection 
of Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and 
Sabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub. 

Carsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who 
wrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific 
expedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He 
documented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf 
and in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two 
names by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr's chart 
of the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that 
century, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia 
1750-1800. pub.1965. 

Al-Sabah ('Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern 
Arabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima's conclusions in his well 
documented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, 
there was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of 
the 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. 
In fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their 
attempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the 
campaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha's expedition against the 
Wahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of 
the Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh 
was under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of 'Utbi external policy 
was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the 
Gulf.'' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait 
was not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra 
(1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.'' (p.183) 

Kuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab 
world. This identity was clear to the British and the French who 
tried to win the support of Kuwait's Sheikh between 1793-95 when the 
British wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the 
Gulf area.

Independent Kuwait 

This is the first of a series of articles that testify to the 
independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the 
Ottomans. 

The following text is related to an expedition carried out by the 
Ottomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields 
in Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh 
Abdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} 

Abdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the 
expedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first 
to use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been 
for this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would 
not have surrendered in a mere three hours. 

In relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships 
refrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in 
reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of 
the progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to 
jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the 
Sultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the 
war against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not 
a party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such 
obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against 
those who had signed it. 


[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the 
Ottomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned 
expedition, please check out the source of the above text:

Independent Kuwait--2 

This is another article of a series of articles that testify to the 
independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the 
Ottomans. 

The following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, 
Iraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. 

In 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the 
estate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This 
property was sequestered by a Turkish Qa'immaqam [representative] on 
the basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the 
owner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, 
Sheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at 
the island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian 
territory. 

It should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start 
showed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn 
Sabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his 
father's agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail 
upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven 
years produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were 
entitled to receive. 

Eventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad 
in favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of 
Basra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. 
Some writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the 
Turkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered 
him the title of Qa'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the 
proceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants 
of Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems 
that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the 
British Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to 
abandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests 
that the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh's 
title to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, 
``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go 
against him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support 
from the Wahhabi Amir.'' 

In addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other 
problems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as 
explained above. However, Kuwait's relations with the Ottoman 
mutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several 
instances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when 
pressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them.

Independent Kuwait--3 

This is another article that testifies to the 
independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the 
Ottomans. 


When Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait 
for the first time on March 3, 1863, he was 
met at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh 
Sabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by 
Sheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him 
to the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,'' which had been 
prepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,'' 
says Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.'' 
This description of Pelly's reception indicates that to a certain 
degree it was run according to protocol. 

The government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the 
subject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,'' 
says Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] 
the judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the 
Cazee's decision.'' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there 
seems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an 
army.'' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the 
country, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: 

When my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I 
shall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, 
but I have made many and true friends, grapple them. While other 
states around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or 
ill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. Hold to my policy, and 
though you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile 
and still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.''

Independent Kuwait--4 

This is another article that testifies to the 
independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the 
Ottomans. 


The British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,'' but 
in October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have 
weakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the 
Assistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a 
special mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to 
find out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a 
British line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the 
Mediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor 
of the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The 
salute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three 
days before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. 

After Edmunds' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell 
explained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not 
to ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent 
at Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. 
Therefore, they considered that Jabir's conduct did not indicate any 
change in his friendly policies towards the British. 

If the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so 
also did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most 
wanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as 'Umar Ibn 'Ufaisan, the 
Wahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, 
sought refuge in Kuwait. 

Protection of refugees seeking political 
asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by 
Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an 
indication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait's independence 
from foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if 
necessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful 
neighbors. 

This defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on 
bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with 
the necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. 

As to Kuwait's position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state 
that it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the 
struggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and 
even with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms.

  They were trying to recover land they believed 
  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.  The Kuwaitis pushed 
  just a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he'd settle 
  the dispute the old fashioned way... 

Are you really this cartoonish?  Or do you seriously believe this?  If
so, please post  your proof. 

  Everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq 
  together and concentrated on taking out Saddam.  A strong, united Iraq with 
  an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of 
  the feudal dictatorships in the Gulf. ",4

And the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay from
an unnamed source? You may indeed be confusing *some* Muslims 
with Nazi Armenians. Altogether 30,000 Nazi Armenians served in 
various units in the German Wehrmacht, according to Ara J. Berkian. 
14,000 in predominantly Armenian army units, 6,000 in German army 
units, 8,000 in various working units and 2,000 in the Waffen-SS.[1]

A number of these Nazi Armenians were volunteers from France,
Greece, Rumania and Bulgaria who had chosen to commit
themselves to the German war effort. Derounian says that

""Dashnag Armenians from France bore the mark 'Legion 
Armenienne.'""[2]

That Nazi Armenians like Dro 'the Butcher' and Nezhdeh sided
with the Germans probably had an impact on the decision of
Armenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service.

[2] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), in 'The Armenian 
    Displaced Persons,' ibid., p. 19.

In fall 1942, the Armenian infantry battalions 808 and 809 were formed,
to be followed by battalions 810, 812 and 813 in spring 1943. In the 
second half of 1943 infantry battalions 814, 815 and 816 were created.
These battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units were
attached to the infantry division 162. Also attached to ID 162 were
the field battalions II/9, I/125 and I/198 which were formed between
May 1942 and May 1943. Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the
Nazi army, if battalion II/73, which was not employed at any time, is to be
included.[1] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers.
Armenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours 
red-blue-orange and the inscription 'Armenien.'

While having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the
Second World War, Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler's
defeat. They now backed Stalin's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces,
hoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim 
population would be exterminated. Stalin played on Armenian national
sentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America
for his imperial ambitions.[1] Stalin's ultimatum to the Turkish
government led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine.

I suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have
been referring to; one problem with a highly-interpreted tradition
like this is what happens when a schism occurs, and over time certain
large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor
exactly a ""face value"" interpretation...


While the context of the time is important, value judgments must
ultimately be according to current understanding, or at least to some
base standard (relative stability/success of a society, e.g.).  This
is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people,
for instance: according to the Bible, the surrounding people were
immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits.  We need to look
rather at what those peoples were *really* like.  For instance, in
what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is
symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of
whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue?  By the
Bible's own terms idolatry is inherently evil, but I see no evidence
that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time
were particularly bad people, relative to the people in the Bible.


Sounds good, but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors, which I see
no support for.  One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane
neighbors can be used to make moral points, but that doesn't mean that
the actual neighbors really were inhuman.  More to the point, such
dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain, or
even of a different people dwelling among us, is all too common.


Note that I'm speaking of historical interpretation here, for instance
claiming that Hammurabi's ""an eye for an eye"" was primitive brutal
retribution, while Moses' version was an enlightened benign fine
(because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way).  As
of 3000 years ago or so, they probably both meant the same thing.


I don't belittle the accomplishments, particularly the intellectual
ones, of the Jewish people.  I have given up on trying to think by
analogy, since I don't know of any other 'tribe' that is at all
similar (the closest I can think of are the Romany, but I don't know
enough about them to make a meaningful comparison).  I think a
tradition of reflective study, of flexible rather than dogmatic
interpretation, is a good thing.  I think that with such an attitude a
case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a
1943 Captain America comic (or whatever the Babylonian equivalent
would have been).

I would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue.
Even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination,
grasp at straws, or do other strange things when faced with extreme
suffering, not to mention physiological problems which may lead to
diminished mental capacity.

At the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to
authority I remind readers of what I posted a while back as a kind of
obituary for the late atheist Dr. Albert Sabin. In an old interview
rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time
a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness.
He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a
respirator. As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years.
After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. Don't say
it couldn't happen to you, or that it hasn't happened to others, even if
you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this.
People are different. I admire Dr. Sabin for admitting his human weakness
in that instance. I would not think less of Asimov for similar weakness.

Nevertheless I agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may
well be untrue. In any case they are not evidence for anything besides
the power of early indoctrination and human frailty.",0

of comparable mystery to GRBs, but we have much better data regarding
it.  Theoreticians postulate new particles all the time to explain it,
but no one will actually believe that these particles are real until an
experimentalist (or several) detects them in the lab.

    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.

    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former
Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of
hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.
    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more
than 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an
attack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and
feared dead.
    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending
the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified
refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:"" That's when
the real  slaughter began,"" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to
survive. ""The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and
started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.""
    "" They were shooting, shooting, shooting"", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who
arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through
Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed
in front of her. Her daughter was still missing.
    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.

    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,
were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their
wounds or the cold.
    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in
Agdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the
seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were
women, one shot through the chest at point blank range.
    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they
had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep
stab wounds.
    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city
which  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and
killing one person.

Now wait, there is more.

           IT'S INHUMANE TO IGNORE THIS VIOLENCE

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre:

69 year old Hatin Nine telling:

-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told
me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''

72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:

- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.
  Turks, you must die.''

28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:

- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of
    my eyes.''

Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?
Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?

The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British
Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times
article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before
Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures
of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.

Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these ""lies."" They are saying
""exaggeration."" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the
situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu
town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's
3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...

The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of
this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.

Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability
to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.

Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print
no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the
French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag
was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''

The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots
of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human
rights violations. International reactions must be made with international
cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming
to be civilized.

Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the
right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where
is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,
journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such
as France who are fast to claim leadership of ""human rights?""
Where are you?

Not really. That is what differenciates agnostics from atheists.
As an atheist, I do not believe there is a god, nor do I believe that
there ever was one.
So, those commandments have no meaning to me. Also, there are a lot
of ideas that have no meaning to me: The idea of a chosen people,
the idea of a given right to the land of Israel, the idea of keeping
kosher, the idea of opposing intermarriage, the idea of having a 
Torah that was inspired by god, etc. 
By being an atheist, I cannot support the idea of the Jewish Nation
as defined by a religious principle or based on a religious identity.
For me, religion is just another piece in what constitutes the cultural
identity of the Jewish people. I believe that as a people with a 
cultural identity they constitute a Nation and have the same right as
any other people in the world to have their own State. The same right
as the Armenians have, as the Palestinians have, as the French have,
and as anybody else have.
I cannot say that by accepting a different god someone has lost all 
cultural identification.

                        ( ANOTHER Form of COLD FUSION )

               ( ALTERNATIVE Heavy Element Creation in Universe ) 

               A very simple experiment can demonstrate (PROVE) the 
          FACT of ""BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS"" (reactions like Mg + O 
          --> Ca, Si + C --> Ca, K + H --> Ca, N2 --> CO, etc.), as 
          described in the BOOK ""Biological Transmutations"" by Louis 
          Kervran, [1972 Edition is BEST.], and in Chapter 17 of the 
          book ""THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS"" by Peter Tompkins and 
          Christopher Bird, 1973: 

               (1) Obtain a good sample of plant seeds, all of the same 
                   kind.  [Some kinds might work better that others.]

               (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight 
                   and number.

               (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper 
                   for three or four weeks.

               (4) Separately incinerate both groups.

               (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of 
                   the sprouted group will usually weigh at least 
                   SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.]

               (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for 
                   mineral content.  [Some of the mineral atoms of the 
                   sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier 
                   mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen, 
                   hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..]

          
               BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY, even in our 
          own bodies.

          carbon, such as ""horsetail"" extract, or radishes) can SPEED 
          HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much 
          faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).  
          
               Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro-

               The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms, 
          cause ""STONE SICKNESS"" in statues, building bricks, etc..  
          
               The reaction N2 --> CO, catalysed by very hot iron,

"THE ENEMY WITHIN
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        By Robert I. Friedman
         The Village Voice, May 11, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 19

        | How The  Anti-Defamation League  Turned the Notion |
        | of Human Rights on Its Head, Spying  on  Progress- |
        | ives and  Funneling Information to Law Enforcement |


Roy Bullock wanted to be a spy since he was a teenager in Indiana and
read ""I Led Three Lives,"" Herbert Philbrick's Cold War saga of
penetrating the Communist Party for the FBI.  Philbrick had become an
American folk hero in the 1950s for building dossiers on unsuspecting
colleagues.  It was a time when Hollywood produced more than 30 films
portraying the informer as the quintessential American patriot.  In
Boston, where Philbrick led three lives as an FBI informant, Communist
Party member, and private citizen, the mayor even proclaimed a Herbert
Philbrick Day and presented the spy with a plaque.

For Bullock, a shy young man who was coming to terms with his
homosexuality in the straight-arrow '50s, the life of a double agent
was the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the Communist
menace.

""I was fascinated with Herbert Philbrick,"" Bullock recently told
federal investigators, ""and so I thought I would try to infiltrate the
Communist Part.  In 1957, I went to the Sixth World Youth and Student
Festival in Moscow with the American delegation.  I gave them [the FBI
a full report on it when I returned, along with some photos I took of
some Soviet military vehicles.""

Bullock was hooked.  For the next two years, he worked as an unpaid
informant for the FBI.  But he found his true calling when he became a
paid spy for the Anti-Defamation League in 1960.  Now his activities
are at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent
American history -- a scandal that may end with the ADL's criminal
indictment in San Francisco.

Over a 30-year period, he compiled computer files for the ADL on 9876
individuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes,
including the NAACP, the Rainbow Coalition, ACLU, the American Indian
Movement, the Center for Investigative Reporting, Pacifica, ACT UP,
Palestinian and Arab groups, Sandinista solidarity groups, Americans
for Peace Now, and anti-apartheid organizations.  Bullock, who even
spied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani when
he visited the Bay Area in April 1991, sold many of his ADL files on
anti-apartheid activists to South African intelligence.  Meanwhile,
between 1985 and 1993, the ADL paid him nearly $170,000, using a
prominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its
financial relationship with Bullock.

Last month, police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and San
Francisco, as well as Bullock's home, confiscating computer files and
boxes of documents.  According to court records, Bullock's files
contained the driver's license and vehicle registration information,
in addition to criminal histories on individuals -- much of which was
allegedly stolen from the FBI and police computers.  Bullock, 58, told
the FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base
had been given to the San Francisco ADL office.  ""Based on the
evidence,"" says Inspector Ron Roth, in a police affidavit, ""I believe
that Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying them
with confidential criminal and DMV information.""

What's more, the San Francisco D.A. is investigating Bullock for
tapping phones, accessing answering machines, and assuming false
identities to infiltrate organizations.  Documents seized from
Bullock's home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Area
trash cans: He had the names and phone numbers of employees at the
Christic Institute in San Francisco, as well as telephone message
slips to staff members (including names and phone numbers of callers),
office correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the
senders, and inter-office memos.  He also had receipts from Christic
Institute's bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings,
as well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees, the
dates, and amounts.  Bullock even knew the balance in the Christic
Institute's checking account.

Investigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealed
that the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering material
with Israeli government officials.  What's more, Israel apparently used
tips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled there.

                            *     *     *

The ADL was established in New York City in 1913 to defend Jews, and
later other minority groups, from discrimination.  It led the fight
against racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the
American Nazi Party, and in the 1960s championed the civil rights
movement.

But there was also a darker side.  In the late 1940s, the ADL spied on
leftists and Communists, and shared investigative files with the House
Committee on Un-American Activities and the FBI.  The ADL swung
sharply to the right during the Reagan administration, becoming a
bastion of neoconservatism.  To Irwin Suall, a repentant Trotskyite
who heads the ADL's powerful Fact Finding Department, the real danger
to Jews is posed not by the right -- but by a coalition of leftists,
blacks, and Arabs, who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in
America, as well as the state of Israel.  In the tradition of his
ideological soulmate William Casey, Suall directed the ADL's vast
network of informants, who were given code names like ""Scumbag,""
""Ironside,"" and -- for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta
-- ""Flipper.""

For years, journalists and liberal members of the Jewish community
knew the ADL spied on right-wing hate groups.  As long as the targets
were anti-Semitic organizations like the Liberty Lobby and Lyndon
Larouche, no one seemed to be particularly troubled.  But the Bullock
case reveals that the ADL also spied on groups that have a nonviolent,
and progressive orientation.  This apparent massive violation of civil
liberties may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Francisco,
where the investigation began.  The human rights group faces possible
criminal prosecution on as many as 48 felony counts, including an
indictment for gaining illegal access to police computers.  Says one
source close to the West Coast investigation, ""It is 99 per cent
certain that the ADL will be indicted.""

In the wake of the San Francisco investigation, police probes of ADL
spying are spreading to other parts of the country.  ""We have received
numerous complaints about ADL [spying],"" says Sam Adams, a
spokesperson for the mayor's office in Portland, Oregon.

On April 16, the Harlem-based Black United Fund of New York, and
African American self-help group that Bullock allegedly spied on,
wrote District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, requesting ""an immediate
investigation"" of the ADL.  ""The ADL's actions cause great concern, as
it is a direct and flagrant violation -- at minimum -- of our civil
rights....We call upon you to join with the District Attorney of San
Francisco to...bring and end to this latest form of McCarthyism.""

Gerald McKelvey, a spokesperson for Morgenthau's office, says, ""We
have no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation.""
McKelvey adds that Morgenthau offered to assist the FBI and the San
Francisco D.A.'s office on their pending investigation.  ""They have
not, so far, asked for our assistance.""

The ADL acknowledges sharing information on violence-prone groups with
law enforcement officials.  It also admits to maintaining extensive
files on a wide variety of organizations, but says, in a two-page
press release, ""The vast majority of ADL's files are composed of news
clips, magazine articles, books, journals, and other documents....""

""ADL has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance
violations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency,
and the process by which the League gathers information is presently
under review to insure that no laws are being violated.""

That's what the ADL says for public consumption.  But morale is so low
that its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits.  And
even as other Jewish groups circle the wagons around the ADL in a show
of solidarity, many do so holding their noses.  More than a few Jewish
officials privately say the ADL has to decide whether it is a human
rights group or a secret police agency.

""The ADL is regarded both inside the Jewish community and outside the
Jewish community as the definitive source of information on anti-
Semitism and extremist groups,"" says Daniel Levitas, the former
executive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal, an Atlanta-
based group that monitors anti-Semitism, racism, and hate groups.
""One of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely
tainted the ADL's credibility and reputation with regard to its
objectivity.  This scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the
Jewish community at large because people regard the ADL as synonymous
with American Jewry.""

                            *     *     *

Bullock's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well
with the ADL's Cold War worldview.  In 1960, he moved to Southern
California where he became an ADL spy for $75.00 a week.  Bullock
almost always used his real name when snooping, although he once
called himself Elmer Fink when corresponding with supporters of
Alabama governor George Wallace.  Bullock provided the ADL's office in
Los Angeles with written reports, which were transmitted to Fact
Finding Department head Irwin Suall, according to court records.
Under Suall's stewardship, Fact Finding Department had become the
ADL's heart and soul.  Located at ADL national headquarters across
from the United Nations, the department had assembled a vast library
on ""hate groups,"" culling material from publications, speeches, and
informants reports.

Bullock was more than adept at leading a double life.  Not long after
moving to California, he ingratiated himself with a woman in the John
Birch Society who helped him gain access to the group's Boston office.
There, he found a file the right-wingers were keeping on the ADL.  The
discovery gave rise to speculation in the ADL New York office that
they had somehow been penetrated by the Birchers.

Bullock focused almost exclusively on right-wing extremist groups
until the early 1970s when ADL L.A. head Milton Sinn was replaced by
Harvey Schechter, who encouraged him to target the left as well.  A
few years later, Bullock moved to the Castro District in San Francisco
where he posed as an art dealer.  And ADL fact finder who had
infiltrated the local Arab community had just been exposed.  When the
ensuing scandal died down, Bullock was ordered by the ADL to penetrate
the Arabs.

The ADL was especially concerned about the American-Arab Anti-
Discrimination Committee, founded by the former South Dakota senator
James Abourezk to combat Arab-bashing.  In a page out of the CIA's
dirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization, Bullock
joined the ADC, and then recruited Nazis into the group, apparently
trying to discredit it, according to published reports.

In 1987, the ADL sent Bullock to attend the National Association of
Arab Americans annual congress in Washington.  According to court
documents, Bullock was told to find the source of the group's funds.
Bullock was unable to ""follow the money.""  But he did such a good job
at ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a NAAA
delegation that visited Congress member Nancy Pelosi.

It's not surprising that the ADL penetrated Arab organizations.  But
only acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like ACT UP.  As
far as Bullock was concerned, gay groups in San Francisco were heavily
infiltrated by what he called ""gay left revolutionaries,"" prompting
him to write about their activities for the ADL.

Bullock soon expanded his horizons, moving into the shadowy realm of
foreign espionage after Richard Hirschhaut, the head of ADL's San
Francisco office, introduced him to Thomas Gerard in 1986.  Gerard was
then a detective with the San Francisco Police Department's
Intelligence Unit.  Gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the
CIA in El Salvador in the early 1980s, where he apparently had more
than a passing interest in right-wing death squads.  (Police searching
Gerard's briefcase found extensive CIA literature about torture and
interrogation, photos of blindfolded and chained men, as well as
passports made out to Gerard in 10 different names, including Thomas
Clouseau.  From a remote jungle island redoubt in the Philippines
where he fled last November, Gerard told the Los Angeles Times that he
will blow the lid off the CIA's involvement with Latin American death
squads if he is indicted in the ADL spy case.)

After their very first encounter in the ADL office, Gerard and Bullock
had lunch at McDonald's, ""I liked Tom right off,"" Bullock later told a
San Francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation
was obtained by the _Voice_.  ""Tom is a very charming, roguish
character, with a great deal of integrity.  Let me say here, I
consider Tom Gerard one of the finest policemen I've ever worked
with, absolutely.  Honest, capable, intelligent and 100 percent
American.""

Before long, Bullock was providing Gerard with confidential ADL
reports on various groups and individuals.  In turn, Gerard gave
Bullock classified police intelligence files on local Arab Americans,
skinheads, and others.  Bullock told the FBI that Gerard's material
ended up in his ADL reports.  ""I would say 99 percent of the data that
I got was name, address, and sometimes physical description.  Criminal
history, very rarely,"" Bullock told investigators.  Gerard also gave
Bullock a chart that outlined a vast network of Bay Area Arab American
businessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to Middle East
terror groups, as well as surveillance photos of Arab Americans
receiving weapons training overseas.  Bullock claims that U.S. Customs
in New York gave Gerard the photos.  ""It was understood that Bullock
would be very careful with what he did with the information Gerard
gave him, and that Bullock would not release it except to the ADL or
other law enforcement officers,"" says an FBI report.

There was nothing unusual about Bullock's cozy relationship with law
enforcement.  By the mid-1980s, the ADL was swapping files with
hundreds of ""official friends,"" the organization's euphemism for U.S.
law enforcement and intelligence sources.  The ADL's relationship with
the FBI's counterterrorism office was so close that ADL's reports on
Arab American group's covert ties to Middle East terrorists were ""must
reading.""

It's no accident that police found a 1986 classified FBI report
entitled ""Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)--New
York Area"" while searching the ADL's San Francisco office.  In 1987,
ADL spooks investigated seven Palestinians and a Kenyan studying in
California universities on student visas.  When the ADL discovered
they were disseminating PFLP literature, it informed the FBI, which in
turn took the case to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
After the INS ordered the students deported as subversives, ADL
regional director David Lehrer gloated in the _Los Angeles Times_
about his office's cooperation with law enforcement, although he's
backpedaling now.  The ""Los Angeles 8"" deportation is still under
appeal.

                            *     *     *

While the ADL worked quietly with America's top cops, it enjoyed
similar ties with Israel's spy agencies -- a charge that ADL leaders
vehemently deny.  But as early as July 7, 1961, ADL director Benjamin
Epstein wrote to B'nai B'rith executive secretary Saul Joftes,
requesting $25,000 for his investigators.  ""Our information,"" he
boasted to Joftes, ""in addition to being essential for our own
operations, has been of great value and service to both the United
States Department and the Israeli Government.  All data have been made
available to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are
the source.""

In 1987, the ADL came under FBI scrutiny in the wake of the Pollard
spy scandal.  While assigned to the Navy's Anti-Terrorist Alert
Center, where he had access to the most closely guarded U.S. secrets,
Jonathan Pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for
Israel, which, according to federal prosecutors, ""could fill a room
the size of a large closet...ten feet by six feet by six feet.""
Pollard's handler was Avi Sella, an Israeli air force colonel whose
wife worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer.  Pollard later wrote to
friends that a prominent ADL leader was deeply involved in the Israeli
spy operation.

While there is no proof that anyone connected with the ADL was
involved with Pollard, there is evidence that the ADL freely passes
information to Israeli intelligence.  In March 1993, the FBI
interrogated David Gurvitz, an ADL fact finder in Los Angeles until
1992 when he was fired by Suall for illegally obtaining police
information to use against a rival at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
The FBI pointedly asked Gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information
to Israel.  Gurvitz admitted that in 1992 he had learned from a law
enforcement contact that Michael Elias, allegedly a member of a
radical PLO faction, was scheduled to travel from San Francisco
International Airport en route to Haifa.  Gurvitz phoned the deputy
Israeli consul general in L.A. with the information.  ""Later the same
day,"" according to a 15-page FBI interview of Gurvitz obtained by the
_Voice_, ""Gurvitz was called back by another man, who said he was from
the Israeli Consulate, and who asked Gurvitz to repeat the information
about Elias.  Gurvitz did not get this man's name, but their
conversation was in Hebrew so Gurvitz felt confident the man was
actually an Israeli Consulate official.""

Among the 12,000 names of private citizens that police found in ADL
files in San Francisco was Mohammed Jarad, a 36-year-old Chicago
resident who was arrested in Israel on January 25, for allegedly
distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hamas, the large
Islamic fundamentalist movement in the Occupied Territories.  The
Chicago ADL office runs at least three undercover informants who work
with ""official friends"" in local law enforcement, according to
documents released by the San Francisco D.A. and sources close to the
ADL.  Given these facts, Arab American groups surmise that the ADL has
passed information on Jarad to Israeli intelligence.

One technique used by the ADL to monitor the large Arab American
community in the Midwest was to scan the local Arab press for funeral
notices.  According to sources familiar with the practice, ADL
investigators in unmarked vans videotaped the Palestinian funerals,
which sometimes turned into PLO rallies.  Palestinians have been
detained at Ben-Gurion Airport simply on the basis of having been
filmed attending a funeral in Chicago, according to Suhail Miari, the
executive director of the United Holy Land Fund, whose cousin was an
Arab member of Israel's Knesset.

Shortly after Jarad was arrested, the Israeli government announced
that Hamas was being run from America with money and operational
instructions relayed by courier or fax.  Israel's charges were played
up on the front page of _The New York Times_.  According to well-
placed sources, Yehudit Barsky, an ADL fact finder in New York, worked
closely with Israeli officials on this campaign of vilification,
introducing ""friendly"" reporters to ""official friends"" in Chicago law
enforcement.

Barsky, who is fluent in Arabic, prepared an ADL report about how
Hamas is funded in America.  She identified the Dallas-based Islamic
association for Palestine in North America as the front organization
for Hamas in the U.S.A.  ""Its infrastructure functions as an
interlocking network of organizations, small businesses, and
individual activists,"" says the February 1993 ADL report, which
outlines the organization's development, its activities on U.S.
college campuses, and its ""metamorphosis"" during the Gulf War. It
also traces Hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front-
groups from Plainfield, Indiana, to Culver City, California.  It is
doubtful that Barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data
without the help of ""official friends"" and ADL spies.

Barsky refused to comment.  But she used to talk to Greg Slabodkin as
many as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for
AIPAC, whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the _Voice_.
""The level of cooperation was very close,"" Slabodkin said during a
recent phone conservation from Israel where he is in graduate school.
""If we felt our files were lacking, we contacted the ADL.""

When Sha'wan Jabarin, a 30-year-old Palestinian human rights worker in
the Occupied Territories won a $25,000 Reebok Human Rights Award in
1990, Slabodkin recalls that Barsky faxed AIPAC the man's entire
police file, which she had obtained from the Israeli embassy.  Jabarin
had been arrested numerous times in Israel, and once confessed to
being a member of the PLO after having been severely tortured.
Jabarin, who received a short jail term, became an Amnesty
International Prisoner of Conscience.  Of course, to AIPAC and the
ADL, Jabarin was a terrorist.  Slabodkin, who was ordered to keep tabs
on him when he was in the U.S. to receive his award, called a
representative of Al Haq, the Palestinian human rights group that
employed Jabarin, to obtain his itinerary.  AIPAC even opened a file
on musician Jackson Browne, who presented Jabarin with the Reebok
award.

While the ADL may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of
Arabs, and even left-wing gay revolutionaries, it has a far harder
time explaining its obsession with spying on anti-apartheid activists.
David Gurvitz told the FBI that when he started working as a fact
finder for the ADL in L.A. in March 1989, ADL files already bulged
with information about the Israel-South African connection and anti-
apartheid groups.  ""Gurvitz confirmed that the ADL did routinely
collect information on persons engaged in anti-apartheid activities in
the United States,"" says the FBI report.  While Gurvitz said there
were files in the L.A. ADL office dating to the 1930s, he estimated
the oldest material on anti-apartheid activities dates back to the
late 1970s, paralleling Begin's rise to power in Israel and a
deepening of ties between the Jewish state and South Africa. ""In
about August, 1992,"" says the report of the FBI's March 3, 1993,
interview with Gurvitz, ""an anti-apartheid demonstration was held at
the South African Consulate in Los Angeles.  Participating in the
demonstration were the Los Angeles Student Coalition and the Socialist
Workers Party.  Gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions,
and a subsequent demonstration.  He wrote a report for the ADL on each
of the planning sessions and on the demonstration.  Copies of the
reports were disseminated to Bullock, among others, in care of the San
Francisco ADL office.""

In 1986 Bullock learned that the consul general of the South African
Consulate in Los Angeles would be speaking in Las Vegas at a meeting
organized by Willis Carto, the head of the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby.
""Suspecting that the Consul General did not know who Willis Carto is,""
says the FBI report, ""Bullock suggested to Gerard that they might want
to warn the South Africans.  Gerard agreed and informed the Consul
General, who canceled his appearance.""

A few months later, Gerard phoned Bullock and told him a South African
intelligence officer wanted to meet them.  During a rendezvous in a
hotel near Fisherman's Wharf, the South African said he was interested
in acquiring information on American anti-apartheid activists.  The
South African, who called himself Mr. Humphries, also asked for
information about groups that were advocating divestments.  ""Gerard,
who was present throughout the meeting,"" says the FBI report, ""told
Humphries that he [Gerard] had been employed by the CIA....Humphries
offered to pay Bullock $150.00 per month in exchange for information.
Bullock noted that much of the information Humphries said he wanted
was already in the possession of Bullock and the ADL.""

Between 1987 and 1991, Bullock sold information to South African
intelligence, receiving steady raises, which he split evenly with
Gerard.  ""Bullock said it was his impression, though Gerard never
explicitly told him so, (and Bullock never asked) that Gerard may have
been telling the CIA about his and Bullock's contacts with the South
Africans,"" says the FBI report.  ""Gerard had said he knew the CIA
'resident agent' in San Francisco....Once, after Gerard dropped
Bullock off at Bullock's residence following a meeting with Louie [who
replaced Humphries as their handler], Gerard said he was going to go
to the San Francisco CIA office.""

Al the while, Gerard may have been ""tasking"" Bullock for the CIA.
""Bullock recalled that once, after he had met Gerard, Bullock went to
Chicago, Illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the ADL,""
says the FBI report.  ""The target of the investigation was a group
called the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.  Bullock learned that a
woman [name deleted] was transporting money between the PLO or the
PFLP, and the United States.  Bullock told this to Gerard.  Gerard
later told Bullock that Gerard's 'guy at the CIA' would like to know
more.  Gerard asked Bullock if Bullock would go back to Chicago to
gather more information on the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.
Bullock, however, never did go back.""

Gerard also seems to have had a close relationship with Mossad, which
may have started in 1991 when he went on an ADL junket to Israel.  The
ADL frequently sponsors trips for American law enforcement officials
to Israel, where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts
in various intelligence agencies.  According to an affidavit by San
Francisco police inspector Roth, the ""all-expense paid trip [to
Israel] was more or less a thank-you gift and a liaison gesture by the
ADL to continue the close relationships it has with specific law
enforcement officers from the United States.""

Gerard may have liked what he saw in Israel.  A short time after
travelling there, he went to Addis Ababa where he helped with Mossad's
rescue of Ethiopian Jews.

As Gerard's relationship with South Africa deepened, he talked more
openly about his exploits in the CIA.  ""Bullock recalled Gerard
mentioning that he had been in Algeria on CIA business, and that
Gerard discussed the PLO and 'safehouses,'"" says the FBI report, ""To
this Louie once responded that Israeli intelligence had determined
that the PLO and the African National Congress were cooperating.
Gerard also spoke of having travelled with the CIA to Afghanistan....
Louie also [told Gerard and Bullock] about his adventures inside South
Africa as an intelligence officer.  Both Gerard and Louie traded 'war
stories' and regaled each other and Bullock with tales of 'narrow
scrapes.'""

Although there is still much mystery about what triggered law
enforcement's investigation of the ADL, it was probably the theft of
a classified FBI report on the Nation of Islam from the FBI's San
Francisco office.  Police armed with search warrants recovered the
report in the ADL San Francisco office.  Gurvitz says he had sent a
copy of it to Mira Boland, the director of the ADL's fact finding
division in Washington, D.C.  Boland was preparing an op-ed piece for
_The Washington Times_, in which she argued that the Nation of Islam
should not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of L.A.
because the group is anti-Semitic and violence-prone.  (Boland, who
had arranged the ADL police junket to Israel attended by Gerard,
testified in a 1990 criminal trial in Roanoke, Virginia, that she had
worked for the CIA for 14 months and later was a subcontractor for the
Defense Department before joining the ADL.  During the trial, Boland
admitted to sharing information with a CIA official at an invitation-
only ADL conference.)

After he was questioned by the FBI last fall, Gerard fled to the
Philippines, which has no extradition treaty with America.  Gerard is
believed to have supplied information from police computers not only
to the ADL, but to Israel and South Africa as well.  The _San
Francisco Examiner_ reported that Gerard may be charged with violating
federal espionage laws.

Although Bullock worked for the ADL for 30 years, and Irwin Suall
praised him in a July 1992 memo as ""our number one investigator,"" the
ADL now argues that he was a rogue agent.  In its own defense, the ADL
also asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than
journalists.  After all, ask ADL officials, don't journalists keep
files?

But the difference between the practice of journalism and the ADL's
method of gathering information couldn't be more striking.
Journalists place information in the public domain where they are held
accountable for falsehoods, distortions, and libel.  And for the most
part, journalists don't share their investigative files with foreign
and domestic police agencies.  The ADL has no such inhibition.
Because many of its files are not open to public scrutiny, false
information collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be
corrected.  Once a proud human rights group, the ADL has become the
Jewish thought police.

""The ADL says it's a human rights group not just for Jews but for
everyone,"" says Chip Berlet, a highly respected researcher at the
Massachusetts-based Political Research Associates, which monitors
right-wing extremist groups.  ""That's fine but it can't do that and
spy on Palestinians.  It's blatantly unethical and frankly immoral.""

""My argument to people is that the ADL wears four hats.  Each of the
hats independently is appropriate.  It is a broad-based human rights
group that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination.
It is a group that defends Jews against defamation.  Entirely noble.
Nothing wrong with that hat.  It is a group, whose leaders, at least,
consistently defend the actions of Israel against its critics, which
again is entirely appropriate.  And it is a group that maintains an
information-sharing arrangement with law enforcement.  Again, there is
nothing wrong for a group to do that.""

""But you can't do all four.  It is impossible to do all four and not
violate the bounds of ethics.  There's a built-in conflict of interest
if you wear all four hats.""

ADL national director Abraham Foxman apparently sees no such conflict.
In a September 1, 1992, letter to the _Voice_, Foxman complained: ""ADL
has a proud 80-year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil
rights and constitutional freedoms.  Any imputation of an effort or
motive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is
false and baseless""

""Throughout his pieces [on AIPAC's spying], Friedman describes the
dissemination of information as if it were slander, and the existence
of files as a token of McCarthyite inclination.  The depiction is
misleading in several ways.  Virtually every journalist, academic,
politician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem
relevant; tracing the logic of Friedman's reckless charges, the
Library of Congress is tantamount to the KGB.  Moreover, disseminating
the public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor
McCarthyism.""

But many believe the ADL is increasingly in the defamation business.
Ask Jesse Jackson, James Abourezk, or the leaders of the New Jewish
Agenda -- all past targets of ADL smears.  (At the same time, the ADL
exonerated the fascist World Anti-Communist League, which assisted
Ronald Reagan's covert war against Nicaragua, a policy endorsed by ADL
leaders.)

In the early 1980s, researchers Russ Bellant and Berlet asked to meet
fact finding head Irwin Suall, to discuss their work on anti-Semite
Lyndon LaRouche.  ""Our view then of Irwin Suall was that he was this
really terrific investigator,"" says Berlet.  ""So we introduce
ourselves, say what we are up to and Suall leans back in his chair and
basically runs down a dossier on each of us: about what our political
activities are, who we work with, what organizations we belong to.
Obviously, he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds
admirably.  We were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling
very uncomfortable.""

""And then he leans forward and says, 'The right-wing isn't the
problem.  The left-wing is the problem.  The Soviet Union is the
biggest problem in the world for Jews.  It's the American left that is
the biggest threat to American Jews.  You're on the wrong track.
You're part of the problem.'  We were stunned.  I was virtually in
tears.  This is not how I perceived myself.  We basically stumbled out
of there in a daze.""

               Letters (response to Friedman's article)

         The Village Voice, May 18, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 20

A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN

Robert I. Friedman's assault on the Anti-Defamation League [The Anti-
Defamation League Is Spying On You."" May 11] demonstrates that he has
an axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote.
It also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down
on his list.  The story is replete with inaccuracies, innuendos, and
outright falsehoods, and conveys a picture of ADL so divorced from
reality as to be farcical.  Friedman is even wrong on such basic,
easily determined facts as where ADL was founded (Chicago, not New
York) and the building in which ADL'S San Francisco office is located
(not the Jewish Community Federation building pictured).

ADL has done the work of fighting haters for 80 years, without
""spying"" on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for
the law.  Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti-
Jewish, racist, anti-democratic, and violence-prone, and we monitor
them primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings.
Through the years, we have published scores of reports on anti-
Semitism emanating from both the left and the right.  In fact,
although Friedman's bias leads him to assume the contrary, ADL's
primary concern is still the far right.

Because extremist organizations are highly secretive, sometimes ADL
can learn of their activities only by using undercover sources.
Friedman's hyperbole notwithstanding, these sources function in a
manner directly analogous to investigative journalists.  Some have
performed great service to the American people -- for example, by
uncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training
camps -- with no recognition and at considerable personal risk.  The
information ADL obtains is placed in the public domain, and through
the years ADL has established a reputation for accurate reporting.

Friedman's article, by contrast, contains so much misinformation that
it would take an article equally as long to set the record straight.
A few examples:  He states that an ""ADL leader was deeply involved in
the [Jonathan Pollard] Israeli spy operation,"" and that Pollard's
handler's wife ""worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer.""  Not true.
Friedman also states:  ""ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped
Palestinian funerals.""  Not true.  Elsewhere, he asserts that ADL was
obsessed ""with spying on anti-apartheid activists.""  Again, not true.
We could go on and on -- and, of course, Friedman does not reveal
*his* sources.

The distortion games Friedman plays when he mentions numbers further
reveal his lack of objectivity.  When it comes to how much ADL paid
Roy Bullock a week -- as an independent contractor, not an employee
(an important distinction Friedman also fails to make) -- he includes
the zeros ($75.00, $150.00), inviting the reader to see a large
number.  By contrast, when he observes that ADL paid Bullock ""nearly
$170,000"" between 1985 and 1993, he chooses not to point out that
amounts to little more than $20,000 a year -- hardly an excessive sum.

What is accurate about Friedman's story is Chip Berlet's description
of ADL's four hats.  Yes, ADL looks at broad issues of prejudice and
discrimination.  Yes, ADL defends Israel against critics.  And yes,
ADL maintains an information-sharing relationship with law enforcement
regarding extremist activities and hate crimes.  We see no conflict in
these four activities, and we believe most _Voice_ readers won't
either.

If you look at the bottom of this article you will see that I have very

you like to provide me with an assurance that this practise *never* occurs?


Right, Arabs have been voting in Israel for how long? And in all that time
NOT ONE Arab EVER gained enough of a personal following to get his fellow
party members to put in a Ministry? This is about as likely as sprouting
wings and flying to Rio. What basis do you have for explaining this odd
failure? You seem very confident that you are right, exactly how do you
know, why are you sure?


Exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the Labour party
has never put an Arab into a Cabinet post and insists its coalition
members do the same? Why and on what basis are you reassuring me in
the face of 50 years of discriminatory practise?


Hey what?? As I said even when their party puts them up they get knocked
back. It surely couldn't be because they are Arabs is it?


Well yes, but Security is the reason most often given by people who
want to make excuses. I merely thought it would crop up and so
pre-empted it.

[Comments in square brackets are mine - Yigal]


Racism in the Knesset
---------------------

Coalition requirements on one hand, and the presence of progressive MKs
from _Meretz_ in the coalition on the other, have compelled Rabin and
his friends to change, to some extent, their attitude towards the Arab
public and their representatives in the Knesset.  Although he did refuse
to view them as partners, taking part in the coalition and joining the
government, he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document
of intentions which included a commitment to ""work towards a decrease in
the discrimination between Jewish and Arab citizens"".  [Decrease WHAT?!?!
But posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does
not exist *at* *all*!  Is Rabin, too, a closet self-hater??? - Yigal].

However, racism has not disappeared.  When the Knesset sat to consider
who would staff its various committees, a request was made to put an MK
from Hadash [the Communist party, one of the ""Arab"" parties - Yigal] on
the State Comptroller's Committee.  And oh, did that ever stir up a
storm -- including in the ranks of Labor -- since many Knesset members
find it unthinkable that an Arab MK sit on one of the important house
committees.  ""Security secrets"" are liable to fall into their hands...

This attitude -- which until recently had not even aroused criticism,
being so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people's hearts -- holds
that there are Knesset members who, despite having been elected by tens
of thousands of votes, are not entitled to be full partners in the body
which represents the people of Israel.  We are not speaking here of
political discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- but
of racial discrimination.  The proof: one of the compromises proposed
was that MK Mahamid [an Arab - Yigal] should be replaced by Tamar
Gojanski [a Jew - Yigal] from the same party.  It was not the member's
party which was considered unfit, but his race...

[* Here is a documented case in a respected Israeli newspaper. *]

It is worth noting that for the first time since the state's founding, a
public debate has arisen on this subject, as witness the following
article:


A TEST OF SELF-CONFIDENCE

By Gid'on Levi, Ha'aretz, July 26, 1992

Revelations of discrimination against Arabs have become such an integral
part of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal
with them.  [Do you hear that, -----?  Please contact this Levi fellow
and explain to him how little he knows about Israel.  Please! - Yigal].
Except that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government's
window dressing, and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious.

Last week provided two more such examples: the Israeli Knesset is
finding it very difficult to allow Arab representation on its more
important committees; and Israel Television is finding it no less
difficult to give a platform to Arabs from the territories.  Seemingly
two entirely different matters, but in fact they are one and the same.

The 13th Knesset proved last week that, even though one third of its
members are new faces, it has not renewed its own face at all, at least
on one issue.  Parliamentary traditions may be modernized and
parliamentary traditions may become obsolete, and only one tradition
endures forever: no Arab shall set foot in the more important committees
of the house.  There has never been and never will be an Arab MK on the
External Affairs and Defense Committee or on the Finance Committee.
Worlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not ""to
give"" Arabs, for the first time, a place on the State Comptroller's
Committee.

The arguments are old and well-known: In all three of the above
committees innumerable secrets are revealed -- and woe unto us if an
Arab should hear them.  One must not make light of such arguments, but
their significance should also not be exaggerated.  Every Arab MK is not
spending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over
information from the Knesset committee room to Black Panther
headquarters in Jenin; and not all the aforementioned committees are
continually occupied in the discussion of top-secret matters, which
could safely be revealed, for example, to MKs supportive of the Jewish
Underground, but not to an Arab MK from the Likud, Labor, or even from
Hadash.

The Arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the Subcommittee
on Secret Service Matters, but what would happen, one may ask, if MK
Nawaf Masalha were to hear, God forbid, a review of the Foreign Minister
in an open meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, or even
a review of the Army Chief of Staff which, in any case, are regularly
leaked to the next edition of the news.  And what would happen if MK
Hashem Mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at
al-Najah?

Their non-participation [in important committees] and that of their
colleagues, creates an intolerable situation, where Arab members of the
elected house have only semi-positions.  They are good enough for
addressing plenary sessions, and for voting for or against the
government and participating in the deliberations of the Immigration and
Absorption Committee.  But they must not, for example, participate in
the process of formulating the state budget in the Finance Committee or
in the allocation of resources to local authorities.  In any case, they
have little part in that.

Labor's dependence on the support of the Arab parties has brought about
some improvement: MK Hashem Mahamid, will, it seems, participate in the
State Comptroller's Committee.  Earlier, there had been a ridiculous
attempt made to dictate to Hadash who their representative should be,
and thus to prevent the Arab from entering this dubious holy-of-holies,
but it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional
backing for such a step.

But not to worry: even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices.  The
new Committee Chair, Roni Milo, has already announced that he will set up
subcommittees aplenty for his committee.  Thus he will decide where it
is permissible for Mahamid to participate and where not.  A solution
such as this could, by the way, also have been adopted for the rest of
the committees, thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets
being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from
the Knesset.

And this is just the beginning. Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government will

Armenians? Not a chance.

""Foreword:""

""For example, we were camped one night in a half-ruined Tartar mosque, 
 the most habitable building of a destroyed village, near the border 
 of Persia and Russian Armenia. During the course of evening I asked 
 Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and 
 the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes, 
 I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of 
 those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins."" 

p. 202 (first and second paragraphs).

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead."" 

p. 15 (second paragraph).

""The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages 
 and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of 
 their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley 
 to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following 
 the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt 
 desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. 
 Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized.""

""I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while 
 holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and
 treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all
 Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving
 a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified
 an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility.""

p. 20 (second paragraph).

""Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar
 section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors
 were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great 
 fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they
 smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last
 Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror,
 unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and
 the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished.""

p. 109 (second paragraph).

""As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative
 experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself
 incompetent to rule by legitimate means.

 The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and
 outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing
 body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to 
 do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their 
 fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days.

 The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was,
 as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking
 the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and
 condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method 
 of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the
 condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back
 of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of
 those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became
 a common way of paying debts.""

p. 203 (first paragraph).

""A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the
 point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock 
 and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him
 sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising
 it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey!
 Slodkey!' (Sweet.)""

p. 203 (second paragraph).

""One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the 
 ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about
 it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children.
 The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed
 sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and
 other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the
 dead.""

p. 204 (first paragraph).

""I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of
 a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make
 my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy
 that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of
 a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a
 Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her
 throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a
 year old.""

p. 118.

""Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart
 jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging
 them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the
 carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms.
 Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they
 sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot.

 Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading
 oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians 
 concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and
 scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety.

 This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by 
 barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene....
 That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted
 and completely destroyed.""

p. 192.

""Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the
 retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered
 into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores
 that had been left by the Turks.""

""Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks. Their villages
 were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country.""

""The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order
 of diminishing intensity: Tartars, Kurds and Russians."" 

p. 218. (First and second paragraphs)

""Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians 
 did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners, 
 the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace 
 actions expected and accepted as a matter of course.

 I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground,
 in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless
 and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the
 heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands,
 and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with
 their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself.""

p. 133 (first paragraph)

""In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who
 had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians
 abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of
 these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the
 brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some,
 mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method
 employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after
 crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw.""

p. 19 (first paragraph)

""The Tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of
 ruins. It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. The same 
 fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi.""

p. 22 (second paragraph)

""Many of our men had served in the Russian Army, and were trained soldiers.
 We Armenians were rich and possessed arms. Tartars had never received
 military training. They were poor, and possessed few arms beyond knives.
 ...Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village, the revolution
 in Russia was suppressed.""

p. 97 (third paragraph)

""Within a few years, following the beginning of the movement, an invisible
 government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish 
 Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government. This secret 
 government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called
 'Mauserists' (professional killers) to enforce its decrees.""

""The Dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the Turkish 
 Government.""

p. 99 (third paragraph)

""The Dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their 
 revolutionary activities into the Russian province. They instituted 
 a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing
 contributions to the party funds from rich Armenians. A wealthy
 man would be assessed a stipulated sum. Refusal to pay brought upon
 him a sentence of death. 

 Every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without 
 question. If a man were to be assassinated, lots might be drawn to
 select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the
 'mauserists' of the party.""

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH

ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES 
TO INVESTIGATE THE MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...

As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw 
the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as 
they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to 
journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts 
of the hills.

The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING 
of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians 
last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death 
or missing... 

Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter 
as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there 
was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer 
ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We 
swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon 
under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.

We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round 
again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a 
valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung 
round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired 
repeated blasts.

Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting 
had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed 
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in 
fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. 
I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, 
its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on 
""our side"". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a 
search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.

Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two 
M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed 
flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second 
crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains 
and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters 
were there to give covering fire if necessary.

The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet 
armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani 
official told us that there were now five former Soviet military 
helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. ""They have 
signed contracts to fly for us,"" he said. The helicopter we engaged 
in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian 
pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.

We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an 
heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer 
white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four 
corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an 
Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies 
on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back 
towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before 
the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.

Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the 
civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were 
covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor 
mortis. They had been shot.

What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, 
and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY 
DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

FIGURE IN ADL SPY CASE ARRESTED AT S.F. AIRPORT

    ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon
    arriving from Philippines, where he had fled after FBI
    interrogation.

By Jenifer Warren, Times staff writer

San Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the
Philippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law
enforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation
League was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police
said Friday.

Thomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after
the FBI questioned him about his activities, was apprehended Thursday
night after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard
was returning home.

Gerard, 50, was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday
morning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count
each of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy.

If convicted on all charges, Gerard could face 16 years in prison and
$40,000 in fines.  Bail was initially set at $250,000 after police
argued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000. 
A friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon, a
sheriff's spokeswoman said.

Gerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child,
with whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, and ""wanted to have
his day in court,"" said Police Capt. John Willett, his former boss and
one of two arresting officers.

Gerard, an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from
1982 to 1985, also feared that the CIA was out to kill him, Willett
said.  In an interview with The Times last month, Gerard threatened to
disclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he
was indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges.

Gerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network
operated by the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil
rights organization.  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave
criminal histories to Roy Bullock, a San Francisco art dealer who said
he has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years.

Investigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock's
home computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950
groups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  Files have also been seized
under search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los
Angeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents.

Gerard could not be reached for comment Friday, and his attorney,
James Lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  In the
interview with The Times last month, however, Gerard acknowledged
snooping and sharing some information with Bullock, but denied any
criminal wrongdoing.

Bullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling
intelligence to South Africa.

ADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independent
contractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal
activity.  On Friday, ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard's arrest
""has nothing to do with ADL.  Other than that, we have no comment on
the case.""

Arab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying,
according to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to
pursue the investigation.

""We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly
disclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement,"" said
James Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute in Washington.

Police, meanwhile, characterized Gerard's arrest -- the first in the
inquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough.  A
former police colleague of Gerard, Inspector Fred Mollat, visited
Gerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home.

""I knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever, but
we didn't think it would happen this quickly,"" Capt. Willett said. 
""This development really speeds up our timetable on the case.""

During his 25-year career on the police force, Gerard was a highly
regarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligence
division.  His last assignment was on the gang task force.

After FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall, he took early retirement
and fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan, 300 miles south of
Manila.

Gerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines
Airlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard
after his six-month hiatus, police said.

""He was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked
look on his face,"" Willett said.  ""Then he said, 'Hello, I'm back.'""

"Another one rescued from the bit bucket...

Over the years the furor over this book has been discussed on a.a. and
elsewhere on the net.  Generally, the discussion comes down to the
contention on the one hand that TSV contains such blood libel against
Islam as to merit, if not death, than at least banning and probably
some sort of punishment; and on the other that Rushdie, particularly
as a non-muslim in a Western country, had every right to write and
publish whatever he chose, regardless of whether some muslims find it
offensive, without fear of persecution or death.  

I am naturally inclined to the latter position, but find myself in an
interesting position, because I think this is a fine book, only
incidentally concerned with Islam, and moreover I'm damned if I can
find anything malevolently offensive in it.

Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim
posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book
and had called it such things as ""filth and lies"", ""I would rank
Rushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse"", and so on.
Unfortunately, these comments are usually generalities, and attempts
to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so
offensive have met either with stony silence, more generalizations, or
inaccurate or out-of-context references to the book [which lead me to
believe that few of them have actually read it].  Corrections and
attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored.

Anyway, since I seem to be the only one following this particular line
of discussion, I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have
read this book?  What are your thoughts on it?

"Dale sez;

I don't buy it.  If the things had no value at all, people wouldn't
spend money to make them. So their lack of value is just your
opinion, not an actual fact, which is neither a philisophical or
legal basis for prohibiting them.

On the other hand, I lived in OakBrook IL for a while, where zoning
laws prohibit billboards, as you mention above.  I think it was a
fine law, despite it's contradictory basis.

I would guess that the best legal and moral basis for protest would
be violation of private property.  ""I bought this house, out in
the boondocks, specifically to enjoy my hobby, amateur astronomy.  Now
this billboard has made that investment worthless, so I want the
price of the property, in damages.""  It wouldn't take too many
succesful cases like that to make bill-sats prohibitively expensive.

No wonder that we don't see any detail for this claim. It is good to

are broader definitions of gods used by persons who are considered by

Your use of definitions seems to rest on the assumption: because my

Well I agree with you in the sense that they have no ""moral"" right to inflict
these rules, but there is one thing I might add: at the very least, almost
everybody wants to avoid pain, and if that means sacrificing some stuff for a
herd morality, then so be it.  


Right, and since they grew up and learned around us, they have some idea of our
right and wrong, which I think must, in part, be incorporated.  Very rarely do

I don't think I've changed my stance at all.  My original stance was that

No.  Well, again I stated that a painless death isn't cruel, but I don't
think I stated that all painful executions *are* cruel.  I think that some
are cruel, depending on the nature and duration of the pain.


Anything more than an instant, I guess.  Any death by suffocation
asphyxiation, or blood loss would be cruel, I think (this includes the
gas chamber, and drawing and quartering).  I'd say that any pain that
lasts, say, over twenty seconds or so would be too long (but this may
be an arbitrary cutoff, I suppose).",0

"This poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their
IIsi clock oscillator. I have attempted to gather as many case histories as
possible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies
probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that
success rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24
machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.
This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.

Thanks to all who contributed to this poll. 


Issues:

	Speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without
		add on cards. All reported machines were able to use
		25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple
		Nubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter
		was able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to
		achieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place
	
		At speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and
		hi density floppy disk problems have been reported.
		
		Note: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not
			tested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence,
			the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at
			higher speeds.
			
	Damage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was
		repaired and the machine is operational. One other
		reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator
		during desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user
		putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron.
		
		No reports of static discharge damage.
		
		No reports of high speed operation causing damage.
		
		Then again, I also don't have any reports from users of
		defective parachutes.
		
	Add on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus
		Adapters. Several other add on boards have been used with
		success. See case histories
		
	Heat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed.
		These were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some
		used epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab
		of cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a
		bolt through the hole in the motherboard.
		
		
		
Case Histories:	

All speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator). All reported
CPU versions were 20 mhz.

1)  27.5 mhz operational. Ran for 10 minutes at 31 mhz before crashing.
    No FPU or other add on card
    Heatsinked CPU only
    On 24 hours/day
    No damage during installation
   
2)  27.5 mhz operational without Apple Nubus adapter. 25 mhz top speed with
	Apple Nubus card installed
    Heatsinked CPU only
    On 24 hours/day
    No floppy problems
    No damage during installation
   
3)  27.5 mhz operational. Unable to boot at 31 mhz
    Heatsinked CPU only
    No floppy problems
    No damage during installation

Ha ha.  What a developed sense of humor you have, I'm surprised they let you

foreign aid and talk about where money is really spent.  More money is spent
stationing troops in Germany (ie paying the troops, maintaining bases and equip,
etc) than in Israel.  Plus, Israel does not ask the US to send troops to fight
her battles.  If you look at the amount of money spent defending Korean 
shipping lanes, Norway, and other trouble spots in the world, you will see that
aid to Israel - from a practical standpoint - is not that much.  And so what -
so what if Israel gets the most (assuming I buy your feeble argument)?  What 
is your point?  Do you not want to subsidize Israel?  Well, you have two options
1) Start your own campaign, get elected as president, and then force congress
to cut all aid to Israel or 2) get the fuck out!  If  you don't like how this

Is that how the mind of a compulsive liar works? The scenario and 
genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in x-Soviet Armenia 
is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable 
similarities between the plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. 

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre:

69 year old Hatin Nine telling:

-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told
me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''

72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:

- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.
  Turks, you must die.''

28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:

- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of
    my eyes.''

Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?
Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?

The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British
Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times
article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before
Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures
of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.

Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these ""lies."" They are saying
""exaggeration."" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the
situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu
town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's
3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...

The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of
this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.

Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability
to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.

Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print
no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the
French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag
was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''

The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots
of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human
rights violations. International reactions must be made with international
cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming
to be civilized.

Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the
right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where
is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,
journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such
as France who are fast to claim leadership of ""human rights?""
Where are you?

Cute characterization Bill; however, there is no inconsistency between 
the two statements.  Even if one believes that religion is ""primitive, 
simple-minded and unscientific, anti-intellectual and childish"", one
can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of
complexity to the explanation.  The ideas themselves don't have to be
complex before being excised by Occam's Razor, they only have to add 
unnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description.


I think the non-essential part of an explanatory system is one that
adds no predictive capability to the system.

OK (but I'm right!)  :^)


If that's the ""official line"" taught in those rider education classes
you were refering to, that also don't teach countersteering, I have to
question the quality of the classes.  The ""official line"" in MSF
curricula is as I described.  Maximum braking is achieved by applying
both brakes equally, when the weight distribution is nominally even and
both tires have equal normal forces, and easing off on the rear to
prevent locking it, and increasing braking on the front, as more
traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to
weight shift.

The ""official line"" you have been taught seems ineffective on the face
of it.  Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage
of all the traction available to the rear at time 0, and is halving the
available braking power by using only the front at time 0.


Not necessarily true.  ""Chirping"" the tire indicates impending lockup
(on most surfaces), and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate
maximum braking.  I agree that totally locking the front occasionally
makes one a better rider, but it is a manuver best saved for an
experienced rider, unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like
Code used to use.


True, but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills
(which is how this discussion started), ""keep both wheels just on the
point of sliding"" is nearly useless information.  You need to teach a
*technique*, or at least a strategy, to achieve this.

Rabin: We Must Concentrate on Qualitative Changes in Israeli
Society
 
Today's AL HAMISHMAR quotes Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
Independence Day interview yesterday on Israel Television. Rabin
said that enforcing Jewish sovereignty over the entire Land of
Israel would lead to the establishment of a bi-national state. ""I
would view it as if the historical destiny of my generation, Dor
Tashach, the generation that had the great privilege of determining
the fate of the people and founding the Jewish state, had been
lost.""  Rabin added, ""We must stop dreaming of settlements [i.e. in
the Territories] and focus on qualitative and substantive changes
in Israeli society to make it a productive society dependent on its
own labor."" The Prime Minister concluded saying that he would like
to achieve a significant breakthrough in the peace process during
his government's term.

Thanks for the enlightening post.  Is there a Technical Note on this?

The desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac,
but rather, any of various workstations that use the
68030@25MHz, such as old Suns or old NeXTs.  I used to own a NeXT
68030 cube.   

But I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of
a speed difference I get with my powerbook Duo. I did notice an
extreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus after
installing system 7 on it.  Why does the OS suck up so much CPU
power? 

Also, you're right--software does make a HUGE difference.  I
have the misfortune of using MS-Works on my Duo.  When editing
relatively small (40K) files, cut or copy takes several
seconds, often more than 6 seconds!!  This happens with power
cycling turned off.  As usual, MS software is maggot-infested

I've been following this train of talk, and the question of dismissing atoms as

This does not change the *fact* that ""Muslim"" is a legal and political
term defined constitutionally in former Yugoslavia, and therefore has
meaning and consequences entirely *independent* and *immaterial* of
any religious considerations.
 


You only wish it were so.

More than 2,000,000 residents of Croatia and B-H have *not* accepted the
terms of secession which Tudjman and Izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon
them.  Croats and Muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but
they do not have a right to grab the *entire* territories of the former
Yugoslav republics of Croatia and B-H.

Oh, BTW, *Yugoslavia* was *internationally recognized* when it was 
destroyed by Tudjman, Izetbegovic, Milosevic, and the international
community led by Germany.  If Yugoslavia's borders could be changed
against its will, then certainly Croatia's borders and B-H's borders
can be changed as well.  

As I have stated many times: the civil war in ex-Yugoslavia will end
when the terms of secession (borders, etc.) for Croatia and B-H are
finally agreed upon.  Serbs, Croats, and Muslims will *all* have to
make territorial concessions to reach such an agreement.  ",4

RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as 11 days.  before
it was listed as 9 days.  they just kicked up the number of spacewalks
to 5,  after simulations indicated  that it was not do-able in 4.  

After all the space walking,  they are going to  re-boost the HST's
orbit.  I think right now  it's sitting  at 180 miles up,
they would like  220.  I don't know the exact orbit numbers.
I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest
possible Shuttle orbit. 

Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended
duration orbiter pallet.  It's mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells
and RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support
re-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.

THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS)
and Orbiter Duration.   

In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines
will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy
thing.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel
needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster
carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly
less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle,
for a given orbital change.  

From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are
tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's.

Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess,
that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the
EDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the
flaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,

and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.

or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit.
The reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing,
and longer drag life.

[Alarming amounts of agreement deleted :-)]


That (""complicated"") isn't in fact where P(H) > P(HG) comes from; it's more
the other way around. It's from

  P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG')  where G' is the complement of G

and by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).

In a sense, HG is necessarily more ""complicated"" than H for any H and G,
so I may be splitting hairs, but what I'm trying to say is that irrespective
of subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG)
holds, with equality if and only if P(HG') = 0.


Well, ""P(x | A) = P(x | B)"" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is
operative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not
provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between
the respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference
reduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior
probabilities P(A) and P(B):

  P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>

    P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)

where k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).

So A and B are ""equally consistent with the data"" in that observing x
doesn't give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.

In the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their
prior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don't know
the actual values, and it's this which allows us to deploy the Razor to
throw out any such HG.


That's certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or
not a `divine component' actually underlies the prevalence of religion
in addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious
implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word'.

Now it seems to me, as I've said, that the observed variance in religious
belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather
*less* well if one proposes a `divine component' in addition, since I would
expect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual
exclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn't
even equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission,
G is `divine component', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily
acknowledge that this is a subjective impression.


Not that I'm a statistician as such either, but:

The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of
the (read `my') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with
which I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be
answered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable
to statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in
measurable ways.

This means that these regions of the space of possible observations, 
which I loosely termed ""appearances of god/s"", have some nonzero
probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.

Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to
scatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism
expends on making ""appearances of god/s"" possible must come from somewhere
else (i.e. other possible observations).

All else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn't* an
""appearance of god/s"" must have a slightly higher probability under
atheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such
observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of
the atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease
in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.

Sorry if that's still a bit jargonesque, but it's rather difficult to
put it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties
of conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total
area under them is always unity.

An analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is ""the
coin is fair"", and that B is ""the coin is unfair (two-headed)"". (I've
used A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)

Then

  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1
  P(T | A) = 0.5  }

  P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1
  P(T | B) = 0    }

The observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible
with both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability
expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they
don't actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must
be unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance
of heads.

Say our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The
observation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are
modified according to

                            P(H | A)
  e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m
                              P(H)

and

                            P(H | B)
  e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m
                              P(H)

Now we don't know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but
the multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time
the coin is tossed and a head is observed.

Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have

                 n
  e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)

and
                    n
  e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),

and since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1
and thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must
decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must
increase, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.

The loose analogy is between ""unfair coin"" and atheism, and between ""fair
coin"" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which
would falsify ""unfair coin"", is analogous to an ""appearance of god/s"",
which would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends
to the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle
is the same.



Quite so, but this type of theism is what I might call ""the G in the HG"",
in terms of our Ockham's Razor discussion, and I'd bin it on those grounds.


The hypotheses don't have to be falsifiable, and indeed in my `model',
the theism isn't falsifiable.



You don't have to. We don't need, in the above analogy, to know *any*
prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the
fair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding
multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity.
You don't need to know the initial values of the running estimates
either. It's clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin)
approaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.

All you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for
observed x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain
events rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible
under Ha, and all else is equal.


Any observations you like; it really doesn't matter, nor affect the
reasoning, provided that there are some possible observations which
would count as ""appearances of god/s"". Examples of this might be
a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer, or of the veracity of
revelation.



OK, we'll downgrade ""*does* interact"" to ""*may* interact"", which would
actually be better since ""does interact"" implies a falsifiability which
we both agree is misplaced.


I'll explain, but bear in mind that this isn't central; all I require of
a theism is that it *not* make the prediction ""Appearances of god/s will
never happen"", as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum
mechanics doesn't make this prediction either, the difference is that
QM and atheism do not form a partition.)

Predictions include such statements as ""Prayer is efficacious"" (implying
""If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious""), or ""Prayer
is *not* efficacious"", or ""Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not
pass, till all these things be fulfilled."" I don't think we have any problems
of misunderstanding here.



That's fine; I don't claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite
number of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and
that as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.




I think you are; an ""appearance of god/s"" is sufficient to falsify
atheism, whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.


No: by way of a counterexample, let X = ""the coin is fair"", or more
accurately (so that not(X) makes sense) ""the two sides of the coin are
different"". This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of
heads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite
number of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable,
and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.




Oops. Sorry. Mea culpa.


We agree here.


""The Rapture will not happen on October 28 1992."" Said Rapture would have
falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened, although its failure
to happen does not, of course, falsify any theisms other than those which
specifically predicted it.

""No phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its
explanation will ever be observed."" That about sums the whole thing up.

"People who criticize ""big Government"" and its projects rarely seem to
have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and
technology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of
supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too
long-term.  

(Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because
of socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to
compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't
has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)

As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve
itself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should
drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But
the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or
some countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So
the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a
lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations,
doesn't it?)

But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to
cost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new
technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture,
despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly
earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in
new technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little
sense to try to save money.

Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY
disagrees about that the wisdom should be.  

It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control
available in industry today were derived from Government projects.
GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes
from DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industry
has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large
construction project now uses these tools.

EACH ONE AND HIS OWN NEVO*

(* A reference to General Azri'el Nevo, Shamir's Military Secretary. 
Irrelevant to this excerpt.)

By Nahum Barne'a

. . .

In mid '91 SHABAK found itself in the center of another storm [...]. 
A year and a half earlier, Khaled Sheikh Ali, 27, a member of the
Islamic Jihad, died at the SHABAK installation in Gaza prison.  The
two SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put
on trial. In September '91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and
sentenced them to 6 months in prison.  As far as is known, this was
the first time in Israel's history that SHABAK operatives were sent to
prison.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the
director of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the
effectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the case
were [...] Barak, Goldberg, and Matza.

When they realized that they were on their own, the interrogators
agreed to talk.  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placed
in charge of investigating the affair.  She [...] questioned the
directors of all SHABAK divisions.  She investigated only the matter
of the death in Gaza prison.  She discovered that not only torture,
but also ""the culture of lies"", which Judge Landau had described in
his report of two years before, were still very much in existence. 
Nothing had changed.

The report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, among
them the Prime Minister, the people at the top of the judicial system
and Judge Landau.  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not
know.  After all, they were dealing only with a single jail and with
low ranking people.  The system bit the bullet and accepted the
explanation.  One of SHABAK's high-ranking officials was transfered
from his very high position to a less high position.

. . .

[""The culture of lies"" referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators'
policy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were
tortured in the course of interrogation.  The Landau commission sought
to correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods --
thus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those
methods were used to extract a confession.  The fact that the need to
lie still persists would seem to indicate that SHABAK is not sticking
to the ""approved"" torture methods. -- Yigal]",4

There is no doubt that Israeli authorities ordered the destruction of
mosques in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall. That does not mean,
however, that once can generalize from this to any other points.  The
entire plaza, mosques and all, was cleared to make it possible for Jews
to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of
them, and which had been denied to them for millenia.

On the other hand, throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel, to the
best of my knowledge, Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided

Now, you're falling through the ice.  Barfie!  We have a playmate for

There is a difference between guerrilla warfare and terrorism.
The former primarily targets enemy soldiers.  The latter primarily
targets civilians, and not necessarily enemy civilans, at that.


Innocent British soldiers?  Like innocent Iraqi soldiers?
THe British were EXECUTING Jewish fighters in what was soon to become
the recognized Jewish homeland.  The British - to their eternal shame
and damnation - were sending shiploads of Jewish refugees, civilians,
back to Europe to be taken care of by Hitler.

By comparison, Palestinean ""fighters"" primarily target tourists,
schoolchildren, babies, worshippers, shoppers, movie-goers and other
such threatening people.  Early Zionist fighters did no such things.

Your comparison is ignorant and odious.


Does it bug you that the ""Israelites"" (they used to be
Israelophiles...) happen to be right?


Are you kidding?  Palestinean Arabs - who comprise a tiny proportion 
of the world's refugee population, who have almost no justifiable
claim to the territory that they desire, who have acted as criminals
in the international community for decades - are being treated like
the most aggrieved and deserving minority in existence, even after
their ignominious support for Saddam in Desert Storm.  How many other
world ""leaders"" have addressed the UN with a machine-gun in hand,
receiving a standing ovation?


You are now parrotting some of the weakest arguments of the
terrorists' apologists.  Congratulations.

"Joachim Martillo writes

If you were to substitute the word ""Jew""/""Jewish"" in this posting where you  
see the word ""Muslim""/""Islamic"", switch Joachim and Mohammed's names around,  
and then repost this, you would get a flood of messages attacking the author  
as an anti-semite. And rightly so. The author of this crap is a racist, pure  
and simple. He obviously has no qualms about being open with it, either,  
unlike some other Arab- and Mulsim-bashers on the Net. 

Now, I for one, am not going to look at Joachim's posting and infer from it  
that all Jews think this way. Sure, there might be some, but this view is not  
a part of Judaism, and it is stupid to believe that all Jews' minds are this  
twisted. However, some Muslims might look at Joachim's flame as a  
reaffirmation of their worst fears about Jews: that they all hate Arabs and  
are racists.

For this reason, I am alarmed that not more Jews on the Net have spoken out  
against what Joachim has said. They have the chance to possibly change the  
anti-semitic views of some people on the net, to show them that all Jews do  
*not* hate all Arabs and Muslims, just like all Muslims do *not* hate all  
Jews. Yet they are missing that chance. Remember, to many people, silence  
implies consent.

"Idea for repair of satellites:

Warning I am getting creative again:

Why not build a inflatable space dock.

Basically deploy one side of the space dock (using a scissor shaped structure,
saw it on beyond 2000), then maneuer the side to next to the satellite and then
move the rest of the dock around the satellite and seal it..
The inflate the dock with a gas (is does not have to be oxygen, just neeeds to
be non-flameble, non-damaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat),
thenheat the space dock (for the astronaut who will be working onthe satellite

I once heard an arguement from a xtian friend similar to this.
""Christianity is a Higher Logic.  Athiest like u will not be able
to understand it.  Your atheist logic is very low.  Only thru faith can 
we understand the Higher Logic in God"".

So I asked him, ""So what is this Higher Logic?""

His answer, ""I don't know.""

This, & the posting above highlights one of the worst things about
xtainity.  It is abundantly clear to both atheists & xtains that
their believe is both illogical & irrational.  Their tactics, therefore:
to disregard logic & rationality altogether.  Silly excuses such as
the ones above and those such as, ""How can u trust science, science
was invented by man!"", only goes to further show the weakness of
their religion.

In my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing, xtains
never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses.
They know it would be a fruitless act, given the irrational nature
of their faith.
They would wait until a person is in distress, then they would comfort
him/her and addict them to their emotional opium.

Never in my life had I met a person who converted to xtainity coz it's
""reasonable"".  Rationality has no place in xtainity (see xtian arguement
against ""reason"" above).

184 ADVENTURES IN THE NEAR EAST

disposal for our journey, I foresaw it would have to become
our headquarters for a considerable time, and therefore went
to some trouble to make it habitable. We had a most peculiar
little locomotive, originally built in America for the Russian
Government, adapted to burn either wood or oil; one covered
truck as men's quarters; one similar, which I fitted up for my-
self and a railway officer; and also a truck to carry wood, three
cars being the utmost our small engine could pull. With this
small outfit we started, rumours of all kinds reaching us before
our departure indicating that the whole situation was rapidly
coming to a head, it being evident that the Turks were becoming~
more and more restive in the face of the inexplicable delay of
the Allies in reaching any definite decision with regard to the
future.

Travelling on this little ""war-time"" railway was indeed an
experience, and it was necessary to carry a ""gauge,"" and to
test the rails with it frequently, for in many places, owing to
the sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the
ballast, the rails required rectification before we were able to
get our train over, even at a foot pace; each bridge also re-
quired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon
it, and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim-
ber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts
whilst we passed over them.

Under these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog-
ress was by no means rapid, and as we had frequently to halt
also to replenish our supply of wood fuel, we considered we
had achieved wonders when, on the evening of the second day,
60 hours and 70 miles out from Erzeroum, we finally entered the
gorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles
to lie. This is the same gorge into which the road from
Erzeroum to Kars descends from the foot-hills to cross the
frontier; the railway, however, follows the main Aras River val-
ley till the frontier gorge enters it, whilst the road cuts off the
corner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of Zivin,
some 15 miles from the main valley.

Soon after entering the gorge, we were confronted by the
first serious fall of rock--about 2,000 tons having fallen from
the cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track. Here,
therefore, we halted, and, sending our engine back, prepared to

Armenians have been doing just that for a long, long time.

Source: ""Hagop Hagopian said to have been part of 1972 Terror Attack at
Munich Olympic Games,"" The Armenian Reporter, February 7, 1985, p. 1.

""Le Matin, the influential Paris daily, based on unidentified sources,
claimed last week that Hagop Hagopian, the founder and leader of one
faction of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA),
was among the Arab terrorists who staged an attack on the living quarters
of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games...

Le Matin added that up to 1982, Hagopian operated out of Beirut, Lebanon,
but escaped from the country when Israeli forces entered the city. It was
about this time that a statement issued by ASALA claimed that Mr. Hagopian
was dead of wounds suffered during a bombing by the Israeli Air Force,
although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and
well and presently is residing alternately in Damascus, Syria, and
Athens, Greece. The paper also noted that the socialist government of
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his P.A.S.O.K. party accepted the
Armenian underground leader with ""open arms"" and still providing him
with assistance simply because of Greece's traditional enmity with Turkey.

Le Matin further adds that ASALA derives only a small portion of its
expenditures from wealthy Armenians who support the cause, with the rest 
coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in
drug trafficking.""

I don't see yours.  It seems to rest on the assertion that everything
is either a subject or an object.  There's nothing compelling about that
dichotomy.  I might just as well divide the world into subject,object,
event.  It even seems more sensible.  Causation, for example, is
an event, not a subject or an object.  

Furthermore, if subject/object were true dichotomy, i.e.

	Everything is either a subject or an object

Then, is that statement a self-evident truth or not?  If so, then it's 
all in the mind of the beholder, according to the relativist, and hardly 
compelling.  Add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved
in its entirety into the ""subjective"" category by an idealist or 
solipsist argument, and that we have this perfectly good alternate
set of categories (subject, object, event) [which can be reduced
to (subject, object, quality) without any logical difficulty] and why
yes, I guess I *am* denying that self-evident truths are all in the mind of 
the beholder.

All of it.

I've responded over there.  BTW - I don't intend this as a strawman, but
as something logically entailed by relativism (really any ethical system
where values are assumed to be unreal).  It's different to say ""Relativists

Yup.


I expect better from you, 'Mau'. No, I take that back, I don't. The 
treaty on the exchange of the Turkish and Greek minorities (1923) left 
no Greek minority in Turkiye, except a few thousand Greeks in istanbul. 
Turkiye is no longer an obstacle for 'Pan-Hellenism.' Although the material 
basis of Greek policy is no longer visible, there is a residue, which 
seems to unite the Pelopenisians, the Greeks who came from Asia Minor, 
the Greeks who are originally from the islands of the Marmara Sea
or those who live in the numerous Aegean islands. This residue is 
also recognizable in the contemporary Greek government.


Not a chance. Greece lost in each and every war conducted ""solely"" 
between Greece and Turkiye: in the Morea in 1821, in Thessaly in 
1897-98, and in Anatolia in 1922. After the Ottoman Empire lost 
World War I, the British landed in 1919 a 200,000 Greek army in 
Izmir to exterminate the people of Turkiye. Are you suffering 
from a severe case of amnesia? The tired and defeated Turks rose up,
formed a National Force under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, and
on August 30, 1922 they annihilated the bulk of the Greek Army.



I love people who don't read and then spout myths as evidence. Where
were Greeks in 1912 and 1913? I guess, they were busy with...

  Greek Efforts to Decimate the Jewish Population of Salonica
             Culminated in 1912 and 1913

  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled
  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially
  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the
  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks
  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to
  the great port of Izmir.

  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual
  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek
  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912
  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,
  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>

  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow
  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to
  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923
  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new
  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a
  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where
  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This
  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting
  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also
  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica
  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By
  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a
  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting
  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the
  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.

  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for
  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.
  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received
  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by
  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in
  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained
  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the
  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during
  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements
  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among
  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim
  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the
  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly
  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as
  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and
  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more
  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-
  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,
  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the
  Empire.>>

REVIEWETTE: ""Loompanics' Greatest Hits""
ISBN 1-55950-031-X (Loompanics)

A selection of articles picked from the books in Loompanics' catalogue.  
Subjects include:

 * Christian Dispensationalism -- how right-wing Christians encouraged 
   the Cold War
 * Satanic Child Abuse myths
 * Religion and censorship
 
Plus lots of anarchist and libertarian stuff, situationism, computers and 
privacy, and so on.  Guaranteed to contain at least one article that'll 
offend you -- like, for example, the interview with Bradley R. Smith, the 
Holocaust Revisionist.  A good sampling of stuff in a coffee table book.  (Of
course, whether you want to leave this sort of stuff lying around on your
coffee table is another matter.)

QUOTE:

""The fundamentalists leap up and down in apoplectic rage and joy.  Their 
worst fantasies are vindicated, and therefore (or so they like to think), 
their entire theology and socio-political agenda is too.  Meanwhile, teen-age
misanthropes and social misfits murder their enemies, classmates, families,
friends, even complete strangers, all because they read one of Anton LaVey's
cooks or listened to one too many AC/DC records.  The born-agains are ready
to burn again, and not just books this time.""

REVIEWETTE: ""The Book of the SubGenius"", J.R. Dobbs & the SubGenius Foundation
ISBN 0-671-63810-6 (Simon & Schuster)

Described by 'Rolling Stone' as ""A sick masterpiece for those who can still
laugh at the fact that nothing is funny anymore.""  The official Bible of the
SubGenius Church, containing the sacred teachings of J.R. ""Bob"" Dobbs. 
Instant answers to everything; causes catalytic brain cell loss in seconds;
the secret of total slack; how to relax in the safety of your delusions and
pull the wool over your own eyes; nuclear doom and other things to laugh at.

QUOTE:

""He has been known to answer questions concerning universal truths with 
screams.  With suggestive silence.  By peeing down his pants leg.  His most
famous sermon was of cosmic simplicity: ""Bob"" standing on the stage with his
hands in his pockets, smoking, looking around and saying nothing.  Heated
arguments still rage among the monks, often erupting into fatal duels, as
towhether the Master consulted his wristwatch during this divine period of
Grace.""

REVIEWETTE: ""High Weirdness by Mail"", Rev. Ivan Stang
ISBN 0-671-64260-X (Simon & Schuster)

An encyclopedia of wierd organizations you can contact by mail.  Space 
Jesuses, Christian vs Christian, UFO contactees, New Age saps, Creationists,
Flat Earthers, White Supremacist churches, plus (yawn) CSICOP, Sceptical
Enquirer and stuff like that.  Not just a list of addresses, though, as each
kook group is ruthlessly mocked and ridiculed with sarcastic glee.  If you
like alt.atheism's flame wars, this is the book for you.  Made me laugh until
my stomach ached.  Revised edition due some time in the next year or two.

   Oklahoma City, OK 73101

   ""Your Watchman on the Wall.""  Another flagellating, genuflecting 
   fundamentalist outfit.  Their booklet ""Entertaining Demons Unawares""
   exposes the Star Wars / E.T. / Dungeons & Dragons / Saturday morning

REVIEWETTE: ""The Abolition of Work"", Bob Black
ISBN 0-915179-41-5 (Loompanics)

A selection of Bob Black's painfully witty and intelligent anarchist tracts
collected into book form.  If I were this good I'd be insufferable.(*) 
Probably the only thought-provoking political book that's fun to read.

QUOTE:

""Babble about 'The wages of sin' serves to cover up 'the sin of wages'.  We
want rights, not rites -- sex, not sects.  Only Eros and Eris belong in our

Remember, pain is just God's way of hurting you.""

REVIEWETTE: ""Principia Discordia"", Malaclypse the Younger
ISBN 1-55950-040-9 (Loompanics)

The infamous Discordian Bible, reprinted in its entirety and then some.  Yes,
you could FTP the online copy, but this one has all the pictures.  Explains
absolutely everything, including the Law of Fives, how to start a Discordian
Cabal, and instructions for preaching Discordianism to Christians. 

QUOTE:

""A Discordian is Required during his early Illumination to Go Off Alone & 
Partake Joyously of a Hot Dog on a Friday; this Devotive Caremony to 
Remonstrate against the popular Paganisms of the Day: of Catholic Christendom

REVIEWETTE: ""Natural Law, or Don't Put a Rubber on Your Willy"",
            Robert Anton Wilson
ISBN 0-915179-61-X (Loompanics)

The author of the Illuminatus trilogy rails against natural law, natural 
morality, objective reality, and other pervasive myths.  Witty and 
thought-provoking work from someone who actually seems to know an argument
from a hole in the ground.

QUOTE:

""Since theological propositions are scientifically meaningless, those of us
of pragmatic disposition simply won't buy such dubious merchandise. [...] 
Maybe -- remotely -- there might be something in such promotions, as there
might be something in the talking dogs and the stocks in Arabian tapioca
mines that W.C. Fields once sold in his comedies, but we suspect that we
recognize a con game in operation.  At least, we want to hear the dog talk or
see the tapioca ore before we buy into such deals.""

"I replied to this query via e-mail, but I think there are some
issues that are worth discussing in public.


I would recommend you to take a look at

1) your dictionary
2) alt.atheism FAQ files

to notice that atheism is _not_ a belief system, and what is common
to all atheists is not a belief, but a _lack of belief in deities_.
I cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without
paying careful attention to this issue. 


IMHO, this is a poor method to do any real survey, although I'm sure the
replies might keep you amused for hours.


No, I do _not_ know what you mean. If you are surveying our individual
philosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not
just another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,
the universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could
hardly be called a philosophical system.

Once more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities. 
Do not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of
philosophy we all agree on.

Some comments on your questions:


I would also like to hear more about this. Have we been able to 'convert'
anyone?


This question contains a contradiction in terms. _Beliefs_ 
cannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be 
beliefs! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become
atheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily
become atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems
it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that
religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.

Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question
quite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire
lack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))


This question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with
these issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.

Sigh, why haven't I seen a good, well-thought survey in the Usenet
for three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net,
anyway? Just to abstract some opinions?

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."" 
 (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of 
 Transcaucasia).

In 1920, '0' percent Turk. 

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead.""

Which was my point. By converting to another religion I do not loose
my cultural identity, I just loose my religious identification.
I consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the 
right to have a State based on religious belief is a form of racism.


To be a part or not of the Jeish Nation is defined by my culture and not
by my religion. Actually, if I am an atheist, which is in fact like 
converting into a non-Jewish in terms of religion, I am still considered as
part of the Jewish Nation.
I can be proud of my Jewish culture while not giving any importance to the
Jewish religion. Or, even more, I can be proud of my Jewish culture while
still be convinced that the real god is another one.
I do not know anyone who lost his memebership to the American nation 
because he changed of god.

I still believe that we should never confusse the actions of States with
the individuals who happen to live there.
In the same way that I do not think it is right to blame all Israelis for the
human rights violations of Israel, I do not think that we should assume
that all Arabs are guilty of the actions of the Arab States.
Some people fled their homes because they were scared. Now they are in
there, still suffering for what they are not responsible.
And, remember that we also were told the same at some point. We ended in
the diaspora. And, of course, I am not for doing to others what I did not

should be lighter than the original HST deployment mission, which achieved the

Aw, c'mon.  The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,
not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.
The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.

I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.
The first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.
This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I
contend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that
the flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,
dinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate
flair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually
that it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and
boring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)

The other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has
a few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and 
tedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly
identify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's
personal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.
(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads
to a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.
Finally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my
big dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which
actually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter
to my use and flamage in general.

In summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may
be the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily
weaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor
applicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a
flatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your 
motorcycle lean to the outside while turning.  The same goes for anyone
who looks like you, too.

Kaufman,
I think we have a problem in this newsgroup: every time somebody puts
down serious questions on Israel, the first response would be ""what about
the Arab countries?"" ...

Most of the Arab countries governments are ruling their people with Iron
fist policy and Dark Ages democracy (if exists). Ironically, these are 
the countries that the ""West"" would like to deal with and would wage 
massive wars to protect them and their resources.

For Israel the situation is different, Israel claims it is a
democracy -- I would call it selective democracy, that abides by Western
democratic standards. If Israel is saying that then
it has to be compared to Western standards. If this comparison is the
advertized propaganda from Israel, then we have to look at seriously at
question that can and should be asked regarding any country advertizing
this standard. 
That is very incorrect, I see you have been brain-washed well, I would
recommend non-Zionist history books).

Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to Purchasing Power
Parity: Turkiye, Greece and Chile are in the same category. That
is, $3,000 - $5,999. 


Source: 'International Economics: Theory and Policy' by Paul R.
        Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld, Harper Collins Publishers,
        1991, (second edition).

In terms of 'Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to 
Purchasing Power Parity,' Greece is in the same category with 
Turkiye.


Indeed, Greek Governments have enormous problems to tackle. The 
economy is in shambles, corruption is rampant, air pollution is 
in outrageous dimensions, state-sponsored terrorism is the name 
of the game and infrastructure is decaying. Another insightful 
article in the New York Times (Sunday, April 7) exposes the dirty 
linen of Greece, and describes her as the pariah of the European 
Community. The article reports that ''...with un-European antics,
Greece uses the Community as a cash register. She squanders, and
at times even steals the European tax payers' money for political  
featherbedding at home. The principal members of the Community
admit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the European
Community.'' This affirmation is testimony to the fact that
notwithstanding her geographic location, Greece is un-European
in mentality and attitude. 

Indeed, during the last 12 years, Turkiye registered a great 
success with regard to economic restructuring. A sound economy, 
ready to be integrated to the world economies, has emerged, 
succeeding to the faltering one, witnessed in the '70s.

Just 12 years ago, Greece used to export double as much as 
Turkiye did. Now inversely, Turkiye's overall exports exceed 
by far that of Greece. As far as the tourism incomes are 
concerned, we are witnessing the same phenomenon.

The governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on 
the infrastructure investments (rather than investing in
world terrorist organizations), thereby solving this issue 
completely. Indeed, in the '70s, it was out of the question 
to conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West. 
Nowadays, this is not the case at all, and in a far remote 
town, even in a village you may have, at any time, a long-distance 
call to any given country.

However, the same could not be applied to Greece. In fact,
it is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany
round the clock. And if you happen to be in the Greek islands,
then your chance will be pretty slim. Therefore, it would not
be an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of 
Greece in regard to telecommunication facilities. Greece,
by virtue of its full membership, has enjoyed all advantages
of the EC, obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies. 
Turkiye, having no access at all to similar financial supports,
has nevertheless managed to create a better economy which 
enabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus
over the last two years. As such, Turkiye deserves to be the
only country in its region having permanent current accounts
surplus.

they have to get the keys from both companies.  People have poked holes

"(sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph)

  Yesterday, in response to Henry Spencer's question about the 
temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, I said ""Dust grains
acts as blackbodies, and they're at 40-150 K.""  Well, I was dead
wrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has
informed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR,
which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field
from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin.
Sorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to
take another ISM class :-(

  In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave
a talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief
overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of
about 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then
gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is 
that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer
solar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;
over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got
scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter
and Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially
Uranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -
we call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,
already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through
Neptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].

  He notes that the two recently discovered ""Kuiper Belt"" objects,
1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same 
mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the
larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,
formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material
into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to
ideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidence
from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different
(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence
for the impact theory.

  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects
remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's 
orbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members
of this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies
will be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane 
frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons
by now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)
is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,
and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms
bright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going
to be very hard to see.

  I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see
a howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his.

  By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby
mission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a
Titan 4 to send the probe on ""just about a rectilinear trajectory""
to Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He'd like
to use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs
MUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there
will be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million
for 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally
offered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced
to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the
marketplace.

  I'm just telling you what he said.

I think you're both right.  Teflon was actually discovered by accident
before WWII.  From what I've heard, they had some chemical (I assume it
was tetrafluoroethylene) in a tank and but the valve got gummed up.
Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized.

The material was useful for seals, but it had a major problem for, say
the linings of vessels: it wouldn't stick to metal.  What the space

That's your claim; now back it up.  I consider your argument as useful
as the following:  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  Therefore
belief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  True, and utterly useless.  (Note, this
is *any* belief, not belief in Gods)

#>Gullibility,

# 
#That's a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the
#field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.

If you believe that, you're incredibly naive.

#That's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to
#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to
#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,
#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.

No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common
with *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn't implied by
what you say before, because you're trying to sneak in ""innate features
of [all] theism"".  The word you're groping for is ""some"".

#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.

No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,
since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed
to the case you are trying to make?

#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
#men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.

I said it reads like a warm up to that.  That's because it's an irrational
and bogus tirade, and has no other use than creating a nice Them/Us 
split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either
side of church walls.

#>|Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. The latter has

O.K., it's oval.  It's still begging the question, however.  And though
that certainly is allowed, it's not rational.  And you claiming to be
rational and all.

At the risk of repeating myself, and hearing ""we had that before"" [we
didn't hear a _refutation_ before, so we're back.   Deal with it] :
you can't use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful.  Someone
who thinks reason is crap won't buy it, you see.

#Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics

Anybody else think Godel was silly?

# 
#I've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions

# 
#An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here
#is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the

#it that way.
#
#Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.
# 
#what is it you are trying to say?

That at some point, people always wind up saying ""this datum is reliable"" 
for no particular reason at all.  Example: ""I am not dreaming"".

#>|Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of

#Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities

IMO, any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational.  That does
not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of
intelligence.  Some atheists are also scientists, for example.

#>I don't understand this.  Can you formalise your argument?
# 
#Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make

Peculiar definition of interesting, but sure.  Now show that a belief
in gods entails the further contents of which you speak.   Why aren't my 
catholic neighbours out killing the protestants, for example?   Maybe they 
don't believe in it.  Maybe it's the conjunction of ""B asserts B"" and
""jail/kill dissenters"" that is important, and the belief in gods is
entirely irrelevant.  It certainly seems so to me, but then I have no

My best advice would be to contact a local dealer (see the yellow
pages under ""Motorcycle Dealers"") and ask for the address of the local
section BMW Owners Club.  The local BMW dealer will give you details
of the BMW Insurance terms and the club will help you with all
details.  Getting a bike from the dealer is the best bet, if you can
afford it.  The warranty is fairly handy as BM bits are made from
solid gold, apart from the parts made from ruby and platinum.  Apparently.

Society is the collection of individuals which will fall under self-defined
rules.  In terms of UN decisions all the sets of peoples who are represented
at the UN are considered part of that society. If we then look at US federal
laws provided by representatives of purely US citizens then the society for
that case would be the citizens of the US and so on.


""Acceptable"" are those behaviours which are either legislated for the
society by representatives of that society or those behaviours which are
non-verbally and, in effect, non-consciously, such as picking your nose on
the Oprah Winfrey show, no-one does it, but there is no explicit law against
doing it. In many cases there are is no definition of whether or not a
behaviour is ""acceptable"", but one can deduce these behaviours by
observation.



In an increasingly litigation mad society, this trap is becoming exceedingly
difficult to avoid. With the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures
in American (and Australian, to bring in my local perspective) culture the
boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may
eventually become the definition of moral behaviour. For instance, some
cultures' dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals.
Most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent. However, is
it moral, according to the multicultural american society? This kind of
problem may only be definable by legislation. 

Obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is
acceptable behaviour or not, and much of this will be due to different
environmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions.  

One thing is for sure, there is no universal moral code which will suit all
cultures in all situations.  There may, however, be some globally accepted
mores which can be agreed upon and instantiated as a globally enforcable
concept. The majority of mores will not be common until all peoples upon
this earth are living in a similar environment (if that ever happens).",0

Well, I agree.  I hope others chime in with suggestions on specific
technologies which could be applied towards the maintenance of an
Earth like atmosphere on a long-duration spacecraft.

I think we should try looking at atmosphere first.
This seems to be the single most fundamental issue in keeping anyone alive.
We're all taught that when supporting a patient
you look for maintaining airway. So, in keeping with my trauma training

we look at the issues surrounding a regenerable atmospheric circuit.

No, if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field, it produces a voltage.
The two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or
move the conductor.  The slow shifting of the Earth's magnetic field isn't
really significant, especially when you consider how weak the Earth's magnetic
field is to begin with.


Well, it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel
the Earth's magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet).  Of course,
this force only works in one direction, and the magnetic field generated has
to be unimaginably powerful.  Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3, and the
earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak.  It would require
some sort of unknown superconductor, and special nonmagnetic construction.
And seriously hardenned electronics (optical computers, perhaps).  And the
physiological danger would be significant (due to the iron content in our
blood, among other things).  In other words, forget it.

"Here is a press release from the White House.

 Text of President Clinton's Letter to Congress on Iranian Assets
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, May 14  -- Following is a letter
President Clinton wrote to Congress on Iranian Assets:

  TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:

       I hereby report to the Congress on developments since the
  last Presidential report on November 10, 1992, concerning the
  national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in
  Executive Order No. 12170 of November 14, 1979, and matters
  relating to Executive Order No. 12613 of October 29, 1987.
  This report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the
  International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c),
  and section 505(c) of the International Security and Development
  Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c).  This report
  covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated
  November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.

       1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian
  Transactions Regulations (""ITRs""), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the
  Iranian Assets Control Regulations (""IACRs""), 31 CFR Part 535,
  since the last report.

       2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (""FAC"") of the
  Department of the Treasury continues to process applications
  for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously
  reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a
  substantial decrease in the number of applications received
  relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.

       During the reporting period, the Customs Service has
  continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin
  merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import
  prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-
  gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions
  and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional
  forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.

       3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the
  ""Tribunal""), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers
  Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims
  before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered
  12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have
  been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were
  awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of
  settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions
  adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions
  dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing
  claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,
  3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of
  Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful
  American claimants from the Security Account held by the
  NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.

       As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen
  below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has
  periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers
  Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by
  the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account
  is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the
  proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the
  United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-
  case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the
  account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.
  The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest
  Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of
  March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was
  $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account
  was $8,638,133.15.

       4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the
  arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.
  Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.
  More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been
  disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary
  withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger
  claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their
  complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable
  awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were
  awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October
  1992.

       5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling
  the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the
  Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (""FCSC"") has continued its
  review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in
  1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The
  FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining
  claims in early 1994.

       6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,
  the Department of State continues to present United States
  Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the
  United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.
  In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of
  supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran's claim
  against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign
  Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United
  States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in
 several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also
  filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure
  of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation
  violated the Algiers Accords.

       7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of
  the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No
  successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda's resignation will
  take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up
  his duties.

       8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve
  important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the
  United States and its nationals.  Iran's policy behavior
  presents challenges to the national security and foreign
  policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to
  Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role
  in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling
  the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.
  Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613
  continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-
  national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal
  to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the
  Congress on significant developments.

This is one of the most ridiculous arguments I have heard from the 
Europeans. ""Let's let the Serbs massacre, rape, and ethnically clean
100,000 Bosnians because we don't want our pretty blue berets there
to get scratched"".  Well, I say, get them the hell out of there if you're
worried for them, but don't deny Bosnians their basic right to self
defense! Lift the embargo against Bosnia, and let them defend themselves.
What makes the UN troops more valuable than the Bosnian people?  They
are letting the civilians die so the soldiers could survive, when
if anything, it should be the other way around.  Idiots like Owen 
expect Bosnians to swallow a forced plan, and just hope this problem
will go away.  Well they're wrong.  If they had got their butts in gear
(that is, if Bosnia had oil) a year ago, much of this could be prevented.
Now, however, the results of this tragedy will last for generations.
That's like forcing the jews to make peace with Hitler. Yeah right.
This, as senator Biden said, reeks of bigotry, and makes me and any 
decent human being for that matter, quite sick.  It should be the
Europeans, not the Americans, who take the inititiative and ask the
other for support.  This is their backyard, not the Americans.
Today it's Bosnia, tomorrow it will be Kosovo and Macedonia, Greece,
and then Turkey, and the damn thing will spread.  Not to mention 
European muslims who weren't even practicing before will rally to
fundamentalism. Good luck handling that, your majesty!  Owen was
upset at the question which compared him to Chamberlain, who hoped
to appease Hitler.  He said that Chamberlain had been in Munich 2 years
before any war, I have been here during a blazing war for the last
18 months.  Well, that makes him even worse, because Chamberlain could
have at least argued I'm giving Germany the benefit of the doubt,
whereas Owen can't even do that.  What the west is doing is aiding the
Serbs by tying the Bosnians' hands, and making the stupid excuse of their
powerless troops on the ground, who can't even protect the Bosnian foreign
minister in their own armored vehicle, and watch the killers just walk
away!  What kind of peace is this?  What kind of civilization is this?


European leaders are PATHETIC, and are helping a genocide which even they
will not be able to forget.  Yeah, they'll go to Africa and fight for some
damn dictator in their former colony, they'll go to Kuwait and fight for
oil, but in Bosnia not only they won't fight aggression, they'll even
tie the hands of the victim.  Now you tell me who is fooling whom.

	As I don't know this book, I will use your heresay.


	It depends on how he defines God. The way I understand the meaning
of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. Ideas drawn
from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming
scientific assertions that can be falsified, that is, where we can decide
that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations
drawn from them.

	Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within
science to make them more reconcilable, and especially subserviant in a basic
way, to religious dogma. This pursuit always fails.


	Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the
tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge,
or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. It
gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge
while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. Science
and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional
answers, at best. Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful
questions. More questions can be posed than it can answer. At the basis of
sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve
in contradiction.",0

I believe that things are getting mixed here.
Critizicing Israel and/or being anti-zionist is not seeing ""the absolute 
negatives of that culture"". Maybe, because a person can see the positives 
of that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the
State of Israel.
I, for one, consider the actions of the State of Israel with respect to
the human rights of the Palestinian people as an example of an action thaty
opposes what Jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of 
respect and what the Jewish people learned about oppresion, segregation and
years in the diaspora.



He might not want to recognize that. It does not make him a self-hating
Jew, as far as I see it. At most, he is a person who is not telling
the truth.



But, so far, it seems that the blame is always put on ""the other"".
If you read this newsgroup, for example, Israel is never guilty by
herself. She is always responding to the actions of the ""other"", and
it goes as if the actions of Isreal do not also affect the response
of the ""other' in a cycle that never ends. Also, there is blindness to
try to understand what the other feels and why.
There is always and excuse. There is always a rationale to explain why
things happen as they do.
And, what is the worst part for me, there seems to be all the time an
intention to try to de-humanize the ""other"", as if the other did not
care about their future, children, peace, etc, etc.

",4
"
Sadly understandable...


Yes.

To be fair, you should really qualify this as semitic-western religions, but
you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway.


Again, this should really be evaluated at a personal level.  For example, there
was only one Jesus (presumably), and he probably didn't say all that many
things, and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of Christian sects have
arisen.  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and
believes in Christ as in pantheism.  It would seem to go against the Bible, but
it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of ""personal
interpretation"".


This is a good point.  We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a
system of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every
event/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this
system.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least
not without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem
with such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to
the point of ""testing hypotheses"" against the basic premise of the system
without destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all
the tests fail.  In other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate
moralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.


Interesting, but again, when it seems to basically boil down to individual
nuances (although not always, I will admit, and probably it is the
mass-oriented divisions which are the most appalling), it becomes irrelevant,
unfortunately.


Granted


In which case the people become the bullets, and the religion, as the gun,
merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves, if I
may be so bold as to extend your similie?


Also understandable... ;)

useful resolution, wouldn't the illuminating sources wavelength have
to be several orders of magnitude less than size of thing observed?

If an atom is a ""probablity cloud"", lower resolutions would give the
appearance of solidity, but it seems fairly certain that an atom is
not an object is any conventional sense. Obviously I am not a
physicist, but the question does have ramification of a philosophic
nature. Anyway, just a stray thought, carry on ...",0

Jefferson was not the author of the Bill of Rights.  My history
books aren't here, but Jefferson might have been in the group
that did not think that enumerating rights was necessary.

Does anyone out there know how I would get started on writing a

"Hello
	I recently accelerated my Mac Plus (MicroMac 25MHz accelerator) 
and now I can't get my Mac to boot off of the hard disk.  It boots fine 
from a floppy, and I can mount the hard disk using SCSI probe, but I 
cannot get it to boot from the hard drive.  I installed a new driver, so I 
don't think that is the problem.  
	This poses a rather large problem.  I only have 4 Meg of RAM, and 
I need to run Mathematica, which requires 5 Meg.  I was hoping to use 
system 7 virtual memory so that I could run Mathematica.  However, I can't 
run system 7 from a floppy, so I can't get enough RAM.  
	Any suggestions? Thanks for your time--

UPI, and the newspapers who are reporting this being all owned by Saudis
I wonder how secure they are feeling by reporting all of these things,
maybe Saudi Arabia is allowed to have all the human rights violations
it can have, nobody is including them in any list,.. those are designed
for independent states.


why is this reported from Cairo?

.....

Can somebody teach this man some logic?
what is the relationship between a human rights league in  Saudia
and human rights in Bosnia, I guess if we wanted to know what is
in Italy, we should know what is in Brasil (Syrian Joke)


their claim of following Islamic law is the biggest disservice
that they ever did to Islam.

...

But how about human rights in Egypt Mr Amin?",4

Of course,  they then  turn up the REverb, the Gain,  add in the analog
delay line  and the Fuzz box.  I'd think they wouldn't notice the

Ah,  but how do they compare to Mechanical systems :-)",3

An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and
the car in front, but enough to manuver around it.  Keep the bike in
1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that for
engaged/disengaged?), until there are two cars stopped behind you.

When the next BDI cager comes screaching in, simply ride up along side
of the car in front of you.  You don't need to panic and do it, or you
will pop the clutch and stall the engine.  Do is smoothly, just
rapidly.  The cage in front of you will provide MUCH better protection
than anything else (particularly empty road).

      This is the FIRST part of the this FAQ.  The second part is 
  posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about
  system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in
  comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are
  included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three
  sections of this document  before posting. 
  
         All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from
  rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory 
  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory
  FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as
  general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last
  part of the group name followed by ""-faq.Z"", e.g the FAQ for
  comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for
  comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as 
  compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end
  of  the file name when ""getting"" the file, rtfm will automatically 
  decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have 
  these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to 
  mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send
  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/""name""  in the body text where
  ""name"" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.
  general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the
  subject ""help"" for more detailed instructions.   

    

 ==================== 
 I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)
 ====================
  
       Congratulations!  You've come to the right place.  Usenet is 
  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions
  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve
  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used
  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my
  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a
  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box
  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I
  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to
  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs. 
  P.S.  I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.) 
  
       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we
  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the
  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other
  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially
  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read
  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that
  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen
  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has
  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,
  and it's developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any
  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself
  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup
  news.announce.newusers.


 HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1) 
     
         comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,
  a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists
  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ
  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and
  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part
  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are
  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the
  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this
  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named
  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by
  ""-faq"", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is
  stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use
  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command 
  to decompress it.  However if you leave off the "".Z"" extension when
   you ""get"" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file
  before sending it to you. 
  
         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned
  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ
  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to
  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere
  else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand. 
  It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a
  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please
  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh
  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear
  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong
  where. 
  
         To jump to a particular question search for
  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For
  example to find ""Where can I FTP Macintosh software?"" search for
  the string  ""(2.1)"".  To jump to a section instead of a question
  use a zero for  the question number.


 WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)

      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of 
  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup
  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are
  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list
  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup
  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It's posted to that group weekly and 
  available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in 
  /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list 
  for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from
  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now
  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently
  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,
  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has
  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of
  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform
  conversion and printing.  It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp
  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim
  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX
  environment, A/UX.  It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux
  and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at
  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.


 WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)
  
      There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. 
  You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite
  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don't ask
  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft
  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an
  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their
  ways of  communicating.  
  
      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your
  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too
  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering
  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one
  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of
  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a
  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,
  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question
  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered
  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few
  network software designers.
  
         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post. 
  If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra
  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important
  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. 
  For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a
  catch-all newsgroup.
  
         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in
  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs
  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications
  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought
  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps
  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. 
  Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases
  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions
  about non-communications hardware including questions about what
  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to
  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software
  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and
  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about
  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk
  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.
  
         Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. 
  Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development
  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit
  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,
  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the
  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer
  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. 
  
         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY
  technical question about an application that actually begins to
  delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent
  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly
  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)
  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.
    
         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to
  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We
  understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to
  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to
  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and
  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is
  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is
  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not
  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.
  
         Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the
  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. 
  Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more
  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI
  are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a
  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet's a big place
  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in
  comp.sys.mac.


 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF
 THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND
 WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?

      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as
  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to
  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in
  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium
  for answering common questions like this one.
   
         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail
  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it
  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups
  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that
  lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the
  section of this document that answers their question with just the
  click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to
  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they
  can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.

 FTP  (2.0)

 WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)

      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,
  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),
  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu
  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several
  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove
  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from
  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was
  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the
  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless
  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document
  should be available at the above sites.
  
       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians 
  should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se
  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in 
  the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). 
  Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),  
  ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). 
  Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au
  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese
  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp
  (130.69.254.254). 

         A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). 
  This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software,
  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things
  that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth.  Some material
  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other
  sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple
  system software.  Please read the various README documents
  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're
  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute
  material you find here.


 CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)

      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from
  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). 
  The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH
  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available
  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the
  words ""help"" and ""index"" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your
  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files
  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using
  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a
  message with just the text ""help"" (no quotes).


 WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)

      If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above
  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it
  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject ""help."" 
  Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,
  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server
  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi
  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,
  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of
  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as ""archie""
  (no password is needed) and type ""prog filename"" to find what
  you're looking for or type ""help"" for more detailed instructions. 
  For instance you would type ""prog Disinfectant"" to search for a
  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails
  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of
  the name.  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with ""prog
  Disinfectant"", you might try ""prog disi"" instead.  Substring
  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many
  erroneous matches add a "".*\.hqx"" to the end of the substring, e.g.
  ""prog disi.*\.hqx""  Most Mac software available on the net ends in
  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does. 

         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE
  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you
  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the
  net where to find a particular piece of software.


 CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)

      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from
  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please
  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about
  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.


 WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)

      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to
  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they're
  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're
  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format
  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special
  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex
  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure
  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary
  protocol.
  
         How a file has been translated and compressed for
  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have
  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was
  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file
  you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the
  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step
  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary
  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress
  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table
  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs
  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh
  files as they are downloaded.

     A few notes on the decompressors:

      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different
  compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff
  all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,
  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will
  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0. 
  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt
  Expander. 
    
         StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller
  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow
  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep
  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous
  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.
   
         UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX
  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)
  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac
  products, so use them instead when that's an  option.  Translators
  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also
  available by anonymous ftp. 
  
         Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to
  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading
  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the
  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be
  automatically converted on download.  It can't decompress
  everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0
  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an
  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if
  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of
  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the
  info-mac/unix directory.

     A few notes on the compression formats:

      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file
  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text. 
  Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal
  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications
  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating
  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance
  they'll be downloading MacBinary files.
  
      .image: This format is normally used only for system software,
  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be
  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of
  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve
  Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on
  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. 
  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have
  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.
  
      .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don't merit a position in the above
  table because they're self-extracting.  They may have been created
  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be
  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some
  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard
  designation for self-extracting archives created with their 
  payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they 
  append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.


 HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)

      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human
  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you're at a
  university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to
  give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo
  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,
  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt. 
  Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.
    
         If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually
  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer 
  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of 
  protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of
  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system. 
  
         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any 
  means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that 
  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by 
  far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and 
  login.  Type the word ""binary.""  Hit return.  Type ""cd
  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression"" and hit return.  Then
  ""get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin""  and hit return.  Of course
  it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt
  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this
  fails look for something similar.  If you've ftp'd straight onto
  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will
  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If
  you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still
  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make
  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe
  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last
  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals
  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.
  
  
  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)

       You can't.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable
  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac
  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.
  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as
  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may 
  terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement 
  since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going 
  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.  
  (though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send 
  your mother out to get it for you.)  While you're gathering
  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world 
  of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question
  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh
  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a 
  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.



=================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)
================================================================= 

         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific
  problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here. 
  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking
  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step
  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,
  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system
  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your
  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to
  recommend solutions to you.

 IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)

      ""Microsoft Word is crashing"" doesn't say much.  What were you
  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the
  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions
  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. 
  The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions
  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the
  following steps fix the problem.  For example, ""Sometimes
  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error."" is
  not nearly as helpful as ""QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two
  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already
  contain text.""  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug
  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the
  problem and see if it's still there or not.


 READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)

      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and
  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren't documented in the
  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound
  familiar.


 CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)

      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus
  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and
  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.


 REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)  
   
       For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,
  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file
  on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain.  This
  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring
  from original masters will normally fix this.


 REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)  

      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file
  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. 
  See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean
  reinstall. 
  
         If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these
  steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your
  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the
  program.  So it's time to


 ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)  
 
         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem
  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the
  cause of a system or application crash:
  
     a.	Run only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do
     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself
     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin
     launching other applications until you find the one that causes 
     the crash.
     
     b.	If you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you're
     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you 
     can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially 
     when performing complicated operations.
     
     c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit
     addressing.  There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile
     software out there including some from companies that really 
     have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?  
     I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its 
     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.
     
     d.	Boot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears
     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove
     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense
     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs
     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the
     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the
     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,
     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have
     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the
     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the
     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you've narrowed the
     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you've found the
     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make 
     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.


 CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)

      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why
  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the
  software, call it.  If you're lucky the company will have a work
  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they'll at least add the
  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.

    

 ====================== 
 PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)
 ======================

      You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a
  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot
  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to
  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's
  no reason you can't change it yourself.  The following nine-step
  program should be performed about every three months. 


 TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)

      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more
  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a
  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you're at all like me,
  you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for
  applications you no longer have, archives of software you've
  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements
  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no
  longer need.  If you're running System 7 you may also have several
  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty 
  the trash.


 RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)

      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. 
  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension 
  in your collection.  If you don't use the functionality of an
  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably
  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes
  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. 
  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no
  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your
  extension habit can really help avoid crashes. 


 REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)

      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary
  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It
  lets the system know what application should be launched when you
  open a given file and what icons it should display where. 
  Depending on its size each application has one or more
  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files
  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become
  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac. 
  Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with
  a clean slate.  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than
  to defeat an incumbent. 
  
         One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments
  you've stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice
  Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments
  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only 
  if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed. 
  
         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your
  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys. 
  You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild
  the desktop and warning you that ""This could take a few minutes."" 
  Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you
  have the longer it will take.  If you're running System 6 you may
  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.
   
          If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing
  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's
  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the
  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly
  corrupt data structures.    


 ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)

      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950
  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain
  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk
  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this ""parameter
  RAM"" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset
  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys
  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,
  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the
  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter
  RAM.  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General
  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.
   
         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the 
  date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is
  notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this
  opportunity to reset it anyway.


 RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5) 

      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most
  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the
  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these
  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of
  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn't big enough
  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of
  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,
  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and
  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this
  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance
  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.
  
         If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically
  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6
  it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage
  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set
  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all. 
  The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot
  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility
  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks
  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much
  needs to be allocated.  If you're running System 6, get BootMan,
  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.


 REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)

      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if
  you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. 
  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file
  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here's how:

    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.  
    2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out 
        of your System file into a temporary suitcase.
    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the 
        Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple 
        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be 
        replaced in the new installation.  If you're running or 
        installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions, 
        Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level 
        of the System Folder.
    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder 
        is  fine.
    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then 
        choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your 
        model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead, 
        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't 
        need that waste your memory and disk space.
    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the 
        temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System 
        folder.  If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you 
        forgot to take something out in step 3.  You'll need to replace 
        things individually until you find the duplicate piece. 
    7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.
    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file 
        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable 
        system overall.


     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)

      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that
  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even
  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility
  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System
  disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in
  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier 
  version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com
  and run it on all your hard disks.
     
         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that
  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid
  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything
  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general
  work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's
  Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh
  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well
  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do. 
  For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of
  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features
  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.
   
         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they
  can't fix.  When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and
  reformat (4.9).


     BACKING UP  (4.8)

      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be
  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back
  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies
  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate
  from your application and support files then it's easy to only back
  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three
  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk. 
  
         A number of programs are available to make backing up
  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with
  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup
  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder
  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the
  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup
  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.
  
         Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network
  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should
  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,
  doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There
  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD
  Backup from System 6.  


 DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)

      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free
  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the
  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be
  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more
  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several
  ways to defragment a hard disk.
  
         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your
  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while
  you're at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.
   
         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for
  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.
  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag
  about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the
  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before
  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO
  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the
  net by asking for one. 


 REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)

      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a
  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don't
  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is
  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means
  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even
  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are
  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate
  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3
  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may
  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator
  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there's no reason at all not
  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk.
     
         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to
  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software. 
  Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal
  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY. 
  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with
  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat
  your hard disk.
  
         A number of general-purpose formatters are also available
  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like
  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk
  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the
  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition
  ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware
  formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones
  bundled with your hard disk. 
  
         PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and
  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter
  what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and
  data losses are a very good possibility.

"My first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run.
A big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes I was riding with and tried 
to bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me. He kicked the dog a 
couple of times (we were all only going about 10-15mph) and just made the dog
angrier and got away by applying WFO and outrunning the dog who then started
after yours truly. At the time, I had open drag pipes (obnoxiously loud as hell)
and as soon as the dog was about 2 feet away from the right side of my bike, I
pulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 5000rpm and the roar of
the pipes frightened the dog away (probably made the dog's ears hurt like hell)
and he didn't come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either. 

My second encounter was with an already deceased road-kill dog. I wasn't paying 
very close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the
carcass. I looked down just in time to see what I was about to run over so I 
just held onto the handlebars and freaked out. Both wheels went squarely over
the dog's belly with a thump-thump just like running over a piece of a 4x4
lumber. The bike didn't lose any stability at all and I kept on going. After
I got to my destination, I found bits of fur, meat, and blood stuck to
the bottom of my motor and frame...... gross.",2

   The whole question of ""a right to a dark sky"" revolves around the
definition of a right.  Moral rights and natural rights are all well and
good, but as far as I can see, a right is whatever you or someone
representing you can enforce.  In most civilizations, the government or
the church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and
then enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitution
provides a ""Bill of Rights"" from which most if not all legal rights are
considered to derive.  I'm sure that most other countries have
comparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a right
to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in the
U.S.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.  To
keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law
and the International Court of Justice (correct name?) in the Hague,

I am afraid you are mis-directed. NeXTSTEP is an operating system as opposed to 
a package. I have read a little about it but since Steve Jobs does not seem to 
have the marketing capabilities of Bill Gates my info. is limited. Probably why
the far inferior Windows NT is going to be more widely distributed (but that
is another flame-ridden story). Some of the innovative features of NeXTSTEP are
binary compatibility across platforms (eg you can just copy your program from
a Sparc to a PC and it would run, as opposed to buying the version of the package
ported to a PC), graphical object-oriented design (its all WSIWIG postscript), 
supports parallel hetrogeneous processing, and best of all it is based around 
the Mach micro-kernel so you can make it look like Unix with X, or DOS, or NT or 
even VMS if you feel the need. No package out there comes even close. I hope 
people will subscribe to the HyperKnowledge project and NeXTSTEP finally
takes off in my lifetime :-)",3

I am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been 
born from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land, 
yet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself 
a Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature,
not a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying
with the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by 
Westerners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat: 

""If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the
nations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have
opposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. 
They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody ""to worship in their own
way"" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,
in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when 
people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs
differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the
inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and 
where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey
was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere
by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim
countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian
countries.""[1]

""The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came
under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It
was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of
Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a
Romanian nation today"" (Popescu Ciocanel).

""Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without
interfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy
of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most
advanced European countries.""[2]

""...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw
is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples
of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account
of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of
simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into
action, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves
happy!"" (A. de Mortraye).[3]

""Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the
inquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate
victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that
in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and
Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been
living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,
and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the
cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to
appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,
however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,
local courts immediately take them under their protection.""

""In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are
living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and
the synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is
more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition 
to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this 
sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the
dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional
candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in
the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical
processions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing
their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them
which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of 
priests."" (A. Ubicini).[4]

          ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North 
          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, 
          hardcover. 
          

               ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to 
          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. 
          
               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged 
          edition of ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"", 1959.  
          Volume I is ""NOTHING BUT MOTION"" (1979), and Volume II is 
          ""THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"" (1988). 
          
               Most books and journal articles on the subject of 
          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial 
          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by 
          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except 
          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  
          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical 
          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual 
          validity. 
          
               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor 
          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State 
          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books 
          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the 
          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements 
          they contain. 
          
               ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" describes the astrophysical 
          portions of Larson's CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of 
          ""grand unified field theory"" that orthodox physicists and 
          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two 
          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of 
          space and time: 
          
               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE 
          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE 
          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. 
          
               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of 
          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are 
          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. 
          
               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a 
          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic 
          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the 
          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with 
          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-
          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was 
          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with 
          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including 
          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 
          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, 
          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They 
          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And 
          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation 
          ready for those also. 
          
               As a result of his theory, which he called ""THE 
          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM"", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the 
          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, 
          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, 
          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), 
          ""nuclear"" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass 
          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in 
          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be 
          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very 
          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, 
          solutions in principle, ""no other way"" declarations, etc., 
          used to maintain them. 
          
               ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" is divided into 31 chapters.  
          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from 
          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, 
          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that 
          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in 
          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy 
          formation from the MYTHICAL ""big bang"" is a big mystery to 
          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life 
          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and 
          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of 
          SINGLE stars. 
          
               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according 
          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have 
          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies 
          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT 
          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). 
          
               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against 
          observations that contradict their theories would find 
          Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an 
          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY 
          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the 
          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray 
          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from 
          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any 
          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional 
          coincidence).  Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray 
          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER 
          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the ""cosmic 
          sector"".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a 
          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed 
          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE 
          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the 
          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly 
          at random. 
          
               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from 
          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and 
          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted 
          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the 
          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book 
          ""Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey"", by William K. Hartmann, 
          says, ""Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if 
          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars 
          form.... Unfortunately we cannot.""  Larson's book contains 
          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are 
          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, 
          astronomers, and astrophysicists. 


               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., 
          please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson's BOOKS).

Obviously, we have different sources. Bill Moyers (who happens to be a
theist, to tie this to alt.atheism!) in his PBS documentary ""After The
War"" is my main source. (I think I still have it on videotape.) Others
include The Nation and The Progressive.

The rest of the article is mere rationalisation. You may claim that
sanitation plants are strategic ""legitimate"" targets, but what happens to
the civilians in a city with no sewer system? What happens to the
civilians when you destroy water purification plants? And when hospitals
can't handle the resultant epidemics, because there is no more electricity?

And what exactly are your sources? We have all, I'm sure, seen Postol's
interviews in the media where he demostrates how the Pentagon lied about
the Patriot's effectiveness; what is your source for the 70%
effectiveness you claim?

In any case, I don't know if this is relevant to alt.atheism. How about

"I thought I'd share a good experience, too.  I bought the APS Quantum 240 zero
footprint drive in May '92 (back when they still used two separate LEDs on the
front panel and the case was metal).  While traveling with it (it was in my
SE/30 Mac bag, on top of the Mac) this past winter, one of the plastic tabs
holding the front panel on broke, so that the right side of the front panel
was coming forward away from the rest of the drive.  I lived with this situation
until it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with a
network shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take, which gave me
some dead time during which to have the drive sent out).

I called APS for an RMA # and got one, with no questions asked about how the
tab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers --
though nothing else was damaged [well, except for the internal speaker in my
modem, which wasn't that well glued down to begin with] -- yeah, yeah, I'm
never flying with my SE/30 again).  And when I called back to ask whether I
could send it in a little later rather than right away, they had no problem
with that -- even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA # by a
day (they're usually good for 10 days).  The front panel was replaced under
warranty, and the drive was shipped back quickly (I mailed it first class
insured on a Saturday by noon from L.A. to Missouri, and it came back by Fed
Ex by Friday [I don't know exactly what day it came back because I was
traveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon]).

The only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep I talked
to, in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data, suggested that I take the

day I was mailing the thing, that would necessitate breaking the little

	No one is forced to blow up airplanes.  Terrorism is a choice
made by people because they do not want to work for peace.


	There are *lots* of military targets in Israel.  There are
lots of legitamate targets in Israel.  Old ladies, children, and
civilians in general are not acceptable targets.

	If the only person you can kill is a civilian, you hold your
fire.  If that means you can't kill anyone, then you can't kill
anyone.  Claiming that civilain targets are acceptable because they
are easy kills is rediculous.


	Did they make a policy of it?


	Did you mean excuse? :)  Killing a soldier and killing a
civilian are two very different acts.


	No, they killed soldiers so that the British government would
leave.  The objective was not to scare civilains, but show that the cost
of staying was way too high.  

	In contrast, a terrorist kills civilains to scare other
civilains.  They use random violence against people to make a point
that no one is safe until their demands are met.  An analogy would be
the Irgun blowing up Harrods or 10 Downing.


	Thats because you missed the essential point of arab
terrorism, which is to scare civilains away from Israel, by killing
those who have something to do with Israel.  It is to kill Jews
because they might be Zionists.  It is to kill people who live in
Israel because of where they live.  The targets are rarely soldiers,
or other people who understand they might be attacked in the line of
duty, but innocent civilians, to underscore the message that no one
who deals with Israel is safe.


	Oh, you mean you favor the Israelis, outnumbered 2 to 1,
outgunned, surrounded by hostile states only one of which has signed a
peace treaty in 45 years?  You favor the Jews, people like Leon
Klofhinger, a cripple who was thrown off a boat because he was Jewish?
You support the right of the Jewish people to live in peace?

	Not necessarily.  As Shai points out, political appointments are

That's bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of
usefulness is possible within rational systems, it is allowed.
 
Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics
and mathematics are therfore circular.
 
 
 
I've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions
of god here.
 
An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here
is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the
axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems
out of which they are usually derived. ""I exist"" is derived, if you want
it that way.
 
Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.
 
what is it you are trying to say?
 
 
 
Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities
with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or
the way the world works.
 
 
 
Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make
B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that
it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating
evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed)
says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further
contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can
have interesting effects.",0

All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq, not
to ""Liberate Kuwait"", The people who were killed by the invasion are
more (many many more), than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis
in their smaller invasion. I lived in the west, and I have seen how 
your media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against
Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that
led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to
be surprised not to know).
It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid.

What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis over
200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen
if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct
or indirect result of western envolvement.

Human rights in Kuwait? what about human rights in Iraq? why the west
gave Saddam a green light to slaughter his own people? I will give my
reason: because the rich Kuwaitis do not mind to be your salves, so
they deserve some democracy, but Iraqis might not, so they don't.

As simple as that, whether or not you want to admit it.


Not necessarily the best solution, my view of an Islamic state (and
that of Turabi that your media made you hate) includes all the benefits
of a secular state minus the injustices. Did you ever read a book by
Rashid Al-Ghannoushi (Tunisia), Hassan Turabi (Sudan)? You only know
about them from your Self-censured, self-controlled media.

If they make this kind of campaign against such a moderate thinker as
Turabi is, and keep quite about such an extremist Muslim scholar as Bin
Bez of Saudi Arabia is, it just does not encourage any moderation in
our ARab world.

it has become one of the biggest enemies (although less than the other
NewYork daily since Mortimer took it over). It lies, selects facts that
fits its agenda and even prints racist and open anti-Muslim editorials.

What they claimed in that articles is a bunch of lies because while 
the selected facts are true about some of those persons, the other members
are actually defence lawyers and University science professors who wanted
to fight corruption, uncover atrocities against opposition activists and
Shia minority, and generally increase awareness about the rights of all 
citizens. The only thing that is common between those people is their concern
for the deterioration of human rights since the Saudi clan took a green
light from AMerica (after the gulf) to do whatever is necessary to stay
in power. 


Do you know that ALL OF THE SAUDI ULEMA have been taught the same things?
the ones in the official Iftaa are as conservative as the ones that are
opposing it. SOme of the members of the human rights committe are MORE
PRO-WOMEN and wanted to defend them, and that is precisely one reason that
Bin Bez's Fatwah  implied for the ""Illegality "" of this committee
and  for his claim that it represents ""Outside interests""

There is a human rights issue in Saudi ARabia, and YOU and NY times chose
to ignore the main issue and select some of the members of that committee

 million Muslim people)

p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph).

 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.'
 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-'
 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.'
 ""We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space....
 'I don't believe you,"" I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The 
  man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. 
  I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and 
  went inside.

 The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for 
 its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an 
 iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black 
 with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As 
 the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face 
 up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what 
 was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, 
 as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so 
 I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his  
 slashed genitals.""

p. 363 (first paragraph). 

 'How many people lived there?'
 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.
 'Did you see any Turk officers?'
 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'

 ""The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - 
 Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled
 so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into 
 laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense
 of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,
 Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would
 have been.

 From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....
 The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over
 the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last 
 scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, 
 looms, even spinning-wheels.

 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must 
 leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And 
 for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. 
 Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in 
 a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'""

p. 354.

""At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole
 high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,
 but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust
 of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on
 Moslem villages.""

p. 358.

""It will be three hours to take,"" Dro told me. We'd close in on three
 sides.
""The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,"" Merrimanov
said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.
""That is for morale,"" Dro put in. ""We must keep the Moslems in terror.""
""Soldiers or civilians?"" I asked.
""There is no difference,"" said Dro. ""All are armed, in uniform or not.""
""But the women and children?""
""Will fly with the others as best they may.""

p. 360.

""The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet 
 down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said 
 Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'

 Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets
 clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;
 then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the
 spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though 
 I heard our Utica brass roar.

 As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing
 of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,
 dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow
 puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.
 The came a shrill wailing.

 Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about
 house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in
 clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen
 were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.

 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape
 over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked
 breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by
 afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and
 the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.

 At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward
 Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and 
 tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,
 through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-
 arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.""

p. 361 (fourth paragraph).

""Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, 
 large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble 
 where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet 
 had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between 
 the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun 
 dress.

 The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He 
 lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the 
 pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed 
 just below his neck, into the spine. 

 There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was 
 empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking 
 colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead.""

p. 358.

 ""...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled
  north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands, 
  Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar -
  coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would 
  break loose if Versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'Armenian'
  vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan...

  An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips
  smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. That's bloodshed - just
  Smyrna over again on a bigger scale.""

Who benefits from arms sales?  Hint, it isn't normally the gov't.  It is
the contractor that builds that piece of equipment.  Believe it or not,
the US and UK don't export the huge quantities of arms that you have

"A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland
    on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous
    pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near
    Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part
    was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They
    were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became
    enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle
    of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby
    forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were
    visible till morning sunrise.

    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in
    Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in
    the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was
    only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.
    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a
    spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about
    five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the
    upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop
    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of
    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright
    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails
    were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still
    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.

    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if
    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near
    Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969
    we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of
    these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium
    experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we
    have observed 17 satellite launches.

   This is such Bullshit.  Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on
   the part of the Jews, and a massacre defines it best in my
   opinion.  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the
   Jews, a peace pact, but the Irgun purposely broke this
   agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians.  I might
   grant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] but
   nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that
   this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun.  The Deir Yassin
   MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the
   Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland.,...and contrary to
   your belief, many civilians were killed.  Deir Yassin was later
   advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was
   useful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinians
   were rightfully scared off, because they did not want another
   Deir Yassin.  
	   I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here;
   atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs.
   Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are
   and were the good guys in the middle east.  Both Arab and Jew
   suck equally.

rj3s, you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the Irgun
to attack Dir Yassin was its strategic importance. In fact, Begin,
who was in charge of the Irgun, wrote that Dir Yassin was attacked for
its military significance.

Dir Yassin was merely a battle in the War of Liberation. People died.
But the thing was never intended to be a masacre. That this hapenned

This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into
the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There
was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of
state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.
The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was
mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that
many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with
low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for
travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a
university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well
as salary.

During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure
scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they 
were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is
probably because of the ""research mind"" approach, which is not to try
to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution
emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to
discussion about their problems, the job got done.

The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the
future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was
unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the
future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as 
NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly
keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,
making it more difficult for them to act to support research.

The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which
the government supports research the university will not provide funding,
and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,
as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of
a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask
for one?  The answer I will get is, ""Get the money from NSF.""  Now the
money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it
comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from
getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects
get supported, and how much.  

Also, the government decided that the ""wealth"" should be spread.  So instead
of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research
institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into
being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating
reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal
has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals
already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am
proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find 
impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow
I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea
which solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to
something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, 
and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it
is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring 
more than minimal attention of a good researcher.  

I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would
have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government
is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.",3

Okay, I see smilies, so this isn't supposed to be a serious post.
On the other hand, I would suppose it does has some motivation behind
it. Apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion, but there is 
presumably some sort of reasoning behind it. As an argument, this 
statement is worthless. Presuming the Qur'an is a perfect religious 
text (whatever that might be) there is still plenty of room for 
disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials.

I've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made
between two people who in fact _do_ disagree about Islam, which doesn't
presume anything about the Qur'an other than its having sufficient
clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of
Islam. This hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have
disagreements about _all_ issues relevant to Islam.

The Arab Association for Human Rights (HRA) was 
formed in 1988 to address discriminatory practices and 
human rights abuses by Israel against its Palestinian 
citizens.

It is a unique association concerned with the civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights of the 
Palestinian national minority in Israel. Among the issues 
of concern are land confiscation, education, prison 
conditions, unemployment, torture and the unequal 
allocation of Israel's resources.

Today there are around 800,000 Palestinian Arabs living 
within the Green line (the pre-1967 borders of Israel), 
constituting 18% of Israel's citizens. For them it is an 
empty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the 
needs of the Jewish population. Legally and practically, 
Israel has proclaimed itself a Jewish state and early 
promises of equality for non-Jewish citizens have not 
been fulfilled. This is apparent in many areas strongly 
affecting the Palestinian national minority.

Most Arab agricultural land has been confiscated since 
1948. The Arab sector is vastly underfunded and does 
not receive a fair share of state resources. On a day-to-
day level, Palestinians face discrimination in many 
different forms and find it is a struggle to get permission 
to build a house, start a business, find a job or educate 
their children.

You've asked a crucial question that underlies much of the genocide. 
Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity. They speak Serbo-Croatian. But
there is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian
and anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by
changing religion.  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric
who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls
""the people"" (i.e. Christian slavs).  For this reason, the war-criminals
call all the Bosnian Muslims ""Turks"" even though they are not ethnically
Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason,
what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically
identical but religiously ""other"" is called, paradoxically, ""ethnic
cleansing"" rather than ""religious cleansing.""

Thus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of
WWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from
Bosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.

...about the protests over proposals to put a giant billboard into orbit,



Mr. Hathaway's post is right on the money, if a little lengthy.  In short,
an orbiting billboard would be trash, in the same way that a billboard on
the Earth is trash.  Billboards make a place look trashy.  That is why there
are laws in many places prohibiting their use.  The light pollution
complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against
orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain
on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky.

"Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter
than I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big
presentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more
bare-bones.

In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would
hear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,
maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it
in.

After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written
questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only
had monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.

So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question
being read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.
Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all
the difference.

So, on to the substance. The question was 

Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such
as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete
with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed
by Mcdonnell Douglass?

Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,
then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last
part first.

This is to the best of my recollection what he said.

As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better
answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers 
about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High
speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at
this point.

So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial
arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that 
they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them
to persue work on their own.

Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,
this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this
guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space
lifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where
the TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman
of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are
trying to do something with it.  

Anybody know anything further?
Is this really news?
Does this threaten further work on DC-? ?",3

: > I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like. For example, is
: >there a constant sensation of falling? 

Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) replied:
: Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first,
: but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that
: of sky diving.

I'm no astronaut, but I've flown in the KC-135 several times.  I'll
tell you about my first flight.

At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine
straightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab
onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor)
to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my
involuntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could
feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while
you have a cold).

At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response,
since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment
going and keeping track of all the parts during the ""return"" of
gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay
attention to physiology at that time.

After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one
of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion
sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly
-- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid,
concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to
parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I
had to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically
useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in
the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just
this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill.
(He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous
people who don't get sick on the thing.)

I didn't think of it as a ""constant sensation of falling"" so
much as like swimming in air.  It's very close to the sensations
I feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up.

Jerry:
: >And what is the motion sickness
: >that some astronauts occasionally experience? 

Ron:
: It is the body's reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be
: induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress.
: Some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more
: prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental
: part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is
: up or down, ie: the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay
: pointed towards Earth, so the Earth (or ground) is ""above"" the head of
: the astronauts.  About 50% of the astronauts experience some form of
: motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in space to try to
: see how to keep the number of occurances down.

I'm a volunteer in JSC's Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do,
among other things, some of the tests Ron mentions.  I was in one
called the Pre-flight Adaptation Trainer, which consisted of a chair on
a several-degree-of-freedom motion base with moving geometric visual
aids.  The goal was to measure the victim's^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H subject's
responses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated
exposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness
symptoms.

An ""Islamic Bank"" is something which operates in a different fashion to
your modern bank, as I have explained here (on another thread) before.
For example, Islamic banks don't pay fixed interests on deposits, but a
return on investments (which varies according to the market, and is not
fixed like interest is).

Islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the Islamic world.
There are no Islamic banks in ""the West"", including the USA, to my
knowledge.  I doubt if the market for them exists there -- at least not
while ""Islamic banks"" are at a relatively early stage of their
development as is the case now.  BCCI is most certainly not an ""Islamic
bank"" -- did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits?  If the
answer to this question is ""yes"", then BCCI was not an Islamic bank, as
Islamic banks are specifically set up to _not_ pay or charge interest.

Whether some Muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely

"After failing my State of New Hampshire Noise Gestapo test with my HD
Slash cut pipes I installed my new Bubs (which I had been planning to

Two points:

First, I don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly. 
Holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, and
doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced
the dB level! So if any other NH riders need to get this done, make
sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from
the body.

Second, these Bub pipes are bloody terrific. At low revs or cruising

This is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding
of what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth's
atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive
answer is ""photosynthesis"", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis
by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced
is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed
is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of
the resulting reduced material.

On earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic
matter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires
continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow
that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).

This suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without
continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating
an oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a
hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.

There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere
has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least
2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to
weathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback
mechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak
anthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen
level had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about
it.",3

I can't see the need for a single (big? expensive? heavy?) ""mothership"" except
for Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a
""Grand Tour"" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt 
that
the idea of a big ""mother ship"" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather
small, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan
III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot in
common with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a
probe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large ""bus"" spacecraft carrying several
smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.
The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards
Jupiter and beyond. The ""bus"" could have included far more powerful
cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power
source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.
Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements
within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a
relatively great distance.
---
The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the ""real"" Voyagers,
and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in
the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during
the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the
same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in
addition two ""sub-probes"" could have been relased at Saturn, examining
that planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have
enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several
other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune
systems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to
trajectory-related factors. A small ""swarm"" of camera-equipped miniature space
probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a 
small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, 
well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer
planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of
course.

Mat22:29 the scriptures, nor the power of God.

Following from this, he would have been in a wonderful

that the general public ""can't handle the truth"" and then, based on this 
assumption, go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone, who can understand a
good argument, comes along and asks ""why don't you just develop the spinoffs?""
or ""why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like the
military?""  There are some good arguments for space development without relying
on its side effects.  I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs.  I simply think
that the general public deserves more credit than you give them.


And if you're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right.

Here's the story:

(1)  The IIsi *cannot* supply a VGA output.  However...

(2) Some VGA-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal
the Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch ""high resolution color
display""---i.e., Apple's own 640x480 mode.

So, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi, you
need (a) an adapter that converts from the Mac DB-15 connector to the
VGA-style high density DB-15 connector, *but* tells the Mac to use
it's own 640x480 mode, not the VGA 640x480 mode, and (b) a VGA monitor
that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode over
the VGA 640x480 mode (which as I stated in (1) above, the IIsi cannot
produce).

As far as (a) above is concerned, contact

 James Engineering, Inc.
 6329 Fairmount Ave.
 El Cerrito, CA  94530
 510-525-7350
 FAX: 510-525-5740

They can probably get you the right adapter.  Remember: you do *not*
want the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter, because it will try to
have your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot (the computer
will just fail to produce any video signal at all).  Instead, you want
an adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-style
connectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode.  Sorry
for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.

As far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal
with a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of
67 Hz.  These are the spec's of Apple's 640x480 mode.  For comparison,
the VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth and
a 60 Hz. vertical retrace rate.

The monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as
the Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes
in the PC compatible world.

Good luck!

If the peace talks are going to have any realistic chance of success,

they are the ones who will be getting tangible concessions in return
for giving up only intangibles.  If they keep trying to change the

First, you seem to assume all atheists think alike.  An atheist does not
believe in the existence of a god.  Our opinions on issues such as 
capital punishment and abortion, however, vary greatly.  

If you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (Benedikt, I 
presume), then please present your argument as such and do not lump us
all together.

As for the issues, let's start with abortion.  Personally, I do not support
abortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact.
However, I support the right of any woman to have an abortion, regardless
of what my personal views may be, because it would be arrogant of me to tell
any individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body, and the domain
of legislators should not extend into the uterus.  That's my opinion, and I
am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.

I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control, but I 
certainly defend it as an end to itself.  I think most homosexuals would
be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as
nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.  

As for atheists believing all values are biological, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

Finally, there are the issues of war and capital punishment.  An atheist
can object to either one just as easily as a theist might.  You seem to
be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and 
population control.  Could this be the ""atheist cause"" you were referring 
to a few posts back?

"


Of course not. I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever
felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze.
This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear
of getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is
hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did
not answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion,
a lie. I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint
of her existence.


I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe
and analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this
context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the
opposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.

I'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this
group two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,
I decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional
responses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only
a couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,
thank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit
that I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.


I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger, or what
other people told me, but I grew more and more skeptical the more I
read. I learned what it means to use _reason_.

As a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis
of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments
like this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload
considerably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first
attempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: 

No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,
it may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take
a leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. 
But it can still be wrong. 

I found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism
to believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, 
filtering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god
playing any part. 


Oh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better
documented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented
quite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too
much attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of
the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,
the end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.

Jesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.


This is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,
and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I
observe. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the
evidence. 

It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.
I assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.


A liar, how do you know what my attitude was? Try reading your Bible
again. 

I was willing to die for my faith. Those who do are usually remembered
as heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm
lying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is 
very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not
do so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.

Blind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.
But if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing. I just
don't know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence,
it looks like she doesn't.

"%
%By Elias Davidsson - April 1991 (Revision Oct. 1991)

Note - you are already posting ""facts"", some of which are outdated.

The biased presentation of facts, as well as the conclusions that
you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful
exchange that might lead to a ""meeting of the minds"".  It is to those
who read with open mind, that I address myself.

%The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
%Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the
%United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member
%states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial
%discrimination as ""any distinction, exclusion, restriction or
%preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic
%origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing
%the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of
%human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,
%social, cultural or any other field of public life.""

While the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals,
as the text currently stands I know of no country in which
racial discrimination of some sort can not be found.
It makes no mention of the need for for a legislative
violation.

%The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining
%Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The
%important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since
%it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli
%racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of
%Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United
%Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial
%practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.

If you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative
statements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be
applied to any other case where the council perceives some form
of racial discrimination as previously exhibited.

Scarey thought.

%The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of
%the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native
%non-Jews born in that country. 

Actually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not
alienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be
correct, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes
apparent.  This slant permeates the text.

%Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas
%under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most
%of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the
%author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.

The above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting
Beduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups.
Your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the
issue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].

%Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim
%was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant
%opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).

If I recall correctly, at the time ""zionism"" took off, there
was no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any
factual contradictory evidence .

%But the
%Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and
%technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the
%area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native
%Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and
%razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could
%finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000
%non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.

Do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on ""most
of their villages""?

%Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to
%help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their
%political repression and their destitution.

There is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later
used for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the
intention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was
that this was not the case.

You also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded
this.  As you do again, below.

%In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied
%the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus
%another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its
%occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered
%illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security
%Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and
%began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these
%territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.

Not quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions,
though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.
Israel never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other
annexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.

%Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,
%have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of
%international law and UN resolutions.

Out of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship,
what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories
captured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country
previously (other than Iraq) ?

%It must be emphasized that, although these people live under
%different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as
%Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a
%territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).

Incorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against
on an ""ethnic or racial"" basis.  Therefore your above statement is
incorrect.

I also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination,
the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.
However, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist
at the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not
argue racial discrimination during that period!

%Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a
%symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that
%represents them in world affairs.

Once again, some do, some don't.

%The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab
%territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant
%discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.

Another generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care
about anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you
espouse.

%licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the
%right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject
%to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be
%challenged in court.

Incorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal.
Furthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all
of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some
are, but this is not due to the ""whims"" of the military as
much as the sizeof the task/organization.

%Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied
%territories are permitted to carry firearms.

Incorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in
Daheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of
the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.

%Jewish settlers have
%right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents
%of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel
%governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in
%total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will
%of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates
%land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish
%settlement.

That is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what your
purpose is/was in posting this.

%Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them
%consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For
%many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected
%to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by
%the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish
%settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and
%humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to
%vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in
%practice.

Once again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in,
right?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way
you seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but
as a result of what actions?

%Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the
%Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are
%second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on
%such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these
%policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied
%residence and membership rights in most rural communities in
%Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews
%are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government
%starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of
%funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos;
%Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their
%non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and
%understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian
%children are denied the right to learn their history and
%literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end
%of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the
%authorities.

1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.
    It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no
    legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish
    collective.

2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind
    that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has
    never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large
    bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case 
    in point.

3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation
    with regard to educational material.  You have obviously
    never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.
    It is based upon Jordan's school system.

4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another
    gross generalization.  

%The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of
%all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never
%openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the
%country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its
%ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards
%non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is
%made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs
%into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately
%17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen
%of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of 
%ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme
%Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in
%Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the
%Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.

Another generalization, but lets not stop here.
The transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't,
Moledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the
territories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items,
I recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered
previously.

%Although sexual
%relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal,
%they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal
%of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system
%nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.

When was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true,
nor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious
intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and
the lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.

%Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on
%equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has
%not produced any written Constitution. 

Simply incorrect.
The answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the
dynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates your
contentions to the sidelines.

%Zionism predicates a state
%where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,
%a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak
%Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli
%citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be
%Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial
%discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only
%reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the
%very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.

But the discrimination is not based upon race.
Oops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.

%Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that
%does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -
%that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed
%to fail.

Real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail.
Of course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as
you are in your VIEW of things.  Let's not let anything penetrate
shall we!?!  I may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the
amount of patience I have for rubbish at 02:00.

DEPOSITION OF KARINE BORISOVNA MELKUMIAN [1]

Born 1963
Teacher
Boarding School No. 1

Resident at Building 2B, Apartment 21
Block 41A
Sumgait [Azerbaijan]

This is my fate: I had everything, we were a happy family, and now, at 25,
I've become a widow, I'm left to raise my three children alone; the third, not
yet two months old, was born in Yerevan. Igor and I had thought that if it was 
a girl we would call her Raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy, 
we'd call him Arsen, after Igor's grandfather. I had a girl, and I, without
Igor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother.

Our family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew 
up together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16. 
In 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in 
Sumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son,
Seryozha, is four and a half.

First I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from 
work I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were 
Komsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children's organization], and there were 
both Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were 
shouting, ""There's no room for Christians here!"" and ""When we finish with the 
Armenians, we'll go after the Russians!"" And some even cried Out, ""Death to 
the Armenians!"" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became 
frightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen 
downtown. My family couldn't believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich 
Melkumian, wasn't home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o'clock he 
returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was 
smashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I 
was telling him everything, too, and he said, ""What, is there no longer any
government?"" That same day Igor said, ""Papa, something terrible is happening 
in the city."" And he said, ""We'll stay at home, no one will drive us from our 
own home.""

The day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn't go out. We called 
our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the 
same thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an 
Armenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, and I 
called the police: they're wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and 
nonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything.

On February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were 
afraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I 
told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn't 
be coming in. He agreed, and even said, ""Fine, don't come in, we understand 
what's going on in town, don't come in.""

Before that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my 
father-in-law and said, ""Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are 
happening in town."" Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, ""With my own eyes I 
saw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don't know,"" he said, ""we 
should leave town."" Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we 
should go, thinking we'd go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together, 
clothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the 
building manager came by and said, ""Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is 
bad, don't go out."" My father even opened up to him and said, ""Maybe we'll 
drive to the dacha, it'll be safer there."" ""No,"" he said, ""it'll be worse 
there, you'll be safer at home."" He said don't be afraid, if something happens 
I'll send people to save you.

After he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our 
courtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two 
children, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my 
mother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of 
them, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started
breaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, ""Go in that room
and close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won't hear
that there's anyone home."" The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my 
brother-in-law's wife, suggested, ""Let's run out onto the balcony."" We -- the
two daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out
onto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said, 
""Quick, over to the other balcony, or they'll kill you all."" We lived on the
second floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's. At
first we couldn't manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time
people were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I 
pleaded and begged: ""Please, call someone, have someone come!"" I even started 
shouting. ""I'll throw down the children, I'll throw them down, you catch them 
and take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive."" Either they 
were afraid or . . . I don't know what. They looked as though they were 
watching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I'll say it 
again, these weren't the bandits, these were people from the other part of the 
building and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A 
bus even stopped. I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbing
over to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children 
over there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn't yet 
seven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first; 
you know, I just don't remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think, 
and Edik's wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and 
crying. My Kristina said, ""Mamma, don't throw us over the balcony, we're 
afraid!"" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina 
didn't even want to climb over. She shouted, ""I'm staying with Grandmother,
I'm staying with Grandma!"" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And 
my mother-in-law shouted, ""Oh no, Kristina's still there, she's still there, 
save Kristina, too!"" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira 
helped us and went back inside.

We started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door. I pounded with my fist, 
Sevil, open the door, open it, please!"" She didn't open it. ""No, go away, go 
anywhere, go, I'm not opening the door."" She was our neighbor, we were 
friends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we 
were going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and 
said, ""Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don't stay here, they'll 
kill us, too, because of you."" I begged, ""Please, at least take the children, 
we'll leave, we'll go back."" ""No,"" she said, ""you have to leave."" Her sons ran 
in, one had a knife. Sevil's brother, he's around 18, shouted at us: ""Get out 
of here, leave, I'll kill you with this knife!"" I became terrified, I took the 
children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down 
and heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard ""The Armenians must be 
killed, they've taken all the best places, all the best apartments!"" One of 
them said, ""Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!"" When I 
heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their 
door for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn't see Zhasmen any 
longer. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay, 
that they would save her.

My head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next 
entryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a 
half. They were crying, ""Mamma, we're scared!"" They were so frightened that I 
didn't even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was 
awful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, ""Open up, let 
me inside!"" He opened the door slightly and said, ""No!"" ""No"" and that was it! 
He said it so sternly: ""No!"" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists 
on the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood 
there, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get 
down on my knees. ""Please, I beg of you, at least take the children."" He 
wasn't an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don't even know how, but he let me 
inside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn't 
passed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn't want 
to open the door. And again I started pleading, ""Please, open the door, it's 
our Ira and Lilia! Open the door!"" And he said, ""No, I'm afraid."" I said again 
and again, ""Please, open the door, please!"" He looked at me. He looked at me 
for a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We 
threw ourselves into each other's arms, crying. Then the man locked us into 
the bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, ""Calm 
the children, and calm yourselves down, too.""

Calm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in 
our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I 
said, ""Igor, Edik, let's say farewell."" And Edik turned around and looked at 
me as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would 
kill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They 
started pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that 
he had told us, ""Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight."" He thought we 
were in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: 
""Edik, Igor, let's say farewell."" Igor didn't think we could climb over to the 
other balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can't believe we were 
able to save ourselves.

Igor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All 
the men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next 
to the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from 
the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: ""Open the door!"" We 
were all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, ""They're home,
they're in there, break down the door!"" And I remember my father-in-law 
whispering, ""They're going to break it down now, it's coming down now . . . ""

He had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were 
going to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal 
chair legs. From outside the door they said, ""We're counting to five, open 
up!"" But we were all quiet, we didn't answer them. We made like no one was 
home. We figured they'd leave, they'd get tired and leave. My father-in-law 
had said, ""It's not possible they'd come into my home. How can that be? 
Everyone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with 
everyone."" And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani 
guest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there 
often, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save 
ourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, ""I'm not 
leaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I'm going to fight 
alongside them."" That's just what she said. She picked up a knife and said, 
""If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight 
alongside my family, I'm not going anywhere.""

We were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and 
shouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor 
at the Lezgin's apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira's 
voice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a 
long time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: ""Open the 
door, what are they doing to Ira, who's shouting, that's Ira shouting, that's 
her voice!"" But the Lezgin said, ""It's nothing, calm down, no, it's not in 
your apartment."" He was lying to me so I'd calm down. Two hours went by and 
the Lezgin opened the door and said, ""Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran 
away."" He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him 
outside, next to the building.

While we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The 
way Ira shouted! She shouted, ""Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!"" 
She repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many 
people there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling, 
whistling--you just can't imagine what was going on, what the roar was like.

Apparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway 
where we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I 
don't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in
particular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed 
over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law 
were climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming 
up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were 
our last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them. 
They were sleeping. I woke them up: ""Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!"" And I tell 
Ira: ""Ira, if something happens, we'll throw ourselves off the balcony."" We 
were on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door 
too, because later he said, ""I opened the door and told them there were no 
Armenians inside."" And after they all left our neighbor went out on the 
balcony himself to see: they were gone.

We weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from 
the building. But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider 
hiding us.

The Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said, 
""Karina, there're no lights on in our block."" The whole block was dark, the 
whole block! It's a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, ""I'm afraid to keep
you until morning, I'm afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving
you."" I said, ""What are you saying, we'll leave now. But we can't just leave
with the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere
else to hide."" He said, ""Well OK, go look."" I asked Ira, ""Ira, do you want to
go?"" Ira said, ""No, I'll stay with the children, Karina."" I said, ""Fine, then
I'll go."" Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one 
was in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at 
after seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never 
went out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a
slaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the 
boarding school and my director answered. He said, ""Karina, where are you?"" I
didn't know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I 
was. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what 
time it was, I asked him, ""What time is it?"" He said 11:20, I think, but I 
don't really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I 
look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there
was the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse 
for a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen 
grabbed my hand and squeezed it: ""Hurry up, let's go . . . Hurry up, come on, 
what are you turning around for?"" I turned around and saw a large truck, it 
must have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck 
like that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the 
fourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police 
then they'll put me away. I couldn't count on them. Before I reached the 
police station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, ""Soldier, in 
Block 41, I don't know if they've killed people or injured them--we need to 
save them!"" And he said, ""Go to the police station and tell them everything."" 
I said, ""I'm afraid to go there, I'm afraid of them."" He said, ""Don't be 
afraid.""

We went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military 
vehicle went to our building. I didn't go with them, they left me at the 
police station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that 
they'd rescue them, too. I didn't know where they were or what had happened to
them.

After a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us 
to the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they 
took us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there, 
very many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was 
only wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots, 
nothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee.

The Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably 
alive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of 
Sumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came 
and told us, ""Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party 
Committee."" My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for 
six days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee 
and waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira 
had only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went 
by. And then one of the functionaries told us, ""Karina, Ira, gather your 
courage. Would you like to go to the burial?"" I said, ""What, did they really 
kill all of them?!"" He said, ""Let's look."" He had a long list, and he started 
reading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in-
law, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law,
and Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said, 
""Get in the car, let's go to the burial.""

We buried our family. I couldn't believe it at the time, I couldn't conceive
of it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my 
children when they're older?

My children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and
grandmother. Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and
grandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, ""My grandma is 
better than anyone!"" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it's 
difficult for her, and once she told her: ""You're a bad grandmother.""

I don't know why, I asked her, ""Kristina, where's Papa?"" and she said, ""They 
killed him."" She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded
Seryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, ""When Papa 
comes I'm going to tell him everything!""

"My Kawasaki KZ 750 L4 has 2-3 millimetres of play on the gearchange
pedal axle, in other words, I can move the axle sideways & up-and-down
for few millimetres to each direction. This doesn't bother me when
riding, but I guess fixing it wouldn't hurt. Last summer I took the
bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted, and the mechanic mentioned
that it should be an easy job. All I would have to do is to remove the
front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that I would find
there. Well, upon a closer inspection I discovered that the gearchange
axle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover. It seems that, in
addition to removing the cover, I would have at least to remove the
sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket.

Question : Would removing this small cover from the left side of the
engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing/seal (Don't know the
exact term in english, sorry) ?

Question : Has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some
other purpose ? Does the oil, for example, stay inside the engine ?

I have found that you should observe the following with almost all new
equipment :

Check for warrany tape.  If none, carefully open unit.

Inspect for loose wires, jumpers, screws, and other trash.

Clean up these manufacturing mistakes.

*Now* power up the unit and check it out.

I can't think of how many things I've bought that weren't okay right out of
the box due to sloppy QC.

I'm worried by the concern about it though, for a number of reasons

For starters, I don't think the piece of light-pollution apparatus

of propaganda on the part of opponents, or wishful thinking on the

Second, this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been
levelled against other projects, that either 1) don't increace light
pollution significantly, or 2) increace light pollution only over the
target area.

#2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested
recently.  While slightly more worrisome, I'd like to point out that
any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of
these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be
concerned, and something any project like that would work against
anyway. And given some of the likely targets, I don't think there's
going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too much
dark sky in the northern CIS during the winter, and I doubt you'll find
many activists in Murmansk demanding the ""natural"" sky back. If anything,
he'll probably be inside, stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp,
making sure he'll get enough vitamin D for the ""day.""

The mirror experiments aren't something they're doing for crass
advertising. They think that if they can build one, it'll be one of
those things people in the affected areas will think they couldn't
have lived without before. And I doubt anyone's going to really be
able to convince them to stop.

The Jerusalem Post is only a small part of the Israeli media ( One

really getting the Israeli media.

A -6 to a -10? Is that why stations such as PBS have run shows which
do not depict the Israeli standpoint at all?

IS that why the Intifada got more coverage in 1987 and 1988 than did
Saddamn gassing Kurds by the thousands?





I am from Montreal. I read the Suburban. Did they ever advocate the
Kahane stupidity of expelling the Arabs? Are they racist?

The Suburban has some columnists that explain the Israeli standpoint.

They are nothing like Kahane. IN any case, the Suburban is a paper

If that ""culture"" referred to is Israeli, being anti-zionist can be seen
as a complete denial of that entity's right to exist and its ""legitimacy"". 
Just as saying that Islam has *no right* to establish and implement a 
""state"" that includes any non-muslims, both are *absolute*, one-dimensional 
views of that culture with regard to the issue of ""state"".


If that were the case, one would expect a few of that culture's positives
to be discussed with regard to the issue at hand. Since the issue *centers*
on Israeli culture, I have yet to hear of *any* positives of that culture
in this discussion.


I agree with you. But I also feel that when a culture feels it is confronted 
by another group that wishes to see that culture ""disassembled"", the first
culture has little choice but to *try* to secure its ""survival"" as well as
maintain its moral center. Since the culture is not about to turn away
from *either* the matter of its survival or the valuing of its moral 
principles, it has the virtually impossible job of ""balancing"". 

To discuss Israel's faults and ""crimes"" without *any* recognition of this
circumstance and *reality* it faces is a conscious decision based on the 
discussant's political biases, NOT on an honest and empathetically open 
understanding of the situation. The same applies to those who attempt to 
paint the Palestinian movement as ""all bad"" and dispense with considerations 
of the *reality* facing them.

You beg the question by centering on the symptoms while the issue
of ""self-hating"" addresses the motivations. I certainly feel that
anyone who expends so much effort inflating, distorting and robbing
human context from aspects of his/her own culture is reflecting
a degree of dislike for it. Since bits of that culture are bound, 
due to his/her upbringing, to be a part of him/her, a bit of self-
dislike seems likely to be mixed in somewhere.

As you well know, this process of *blaming the other* for the morally
questionable actions one side is forced (by the ""other"", of course) to 
take is thoroughly practiced by **both sides**. If you are only hearing
the pro-Israeli crowd's self-supporting arguments, that may be due to
the fact that you are not listening for anything else. *I* certainly
hear the similarly distorting pro-Palestinian/pro-Arab element in
*this* newsgroup (as well as in soc.culture.arabic).


I agree, agree, agree, agree.

However, in my response to the initial discussion above between Davidsson
and those opposing his presentations, I saw Davidsson carefully putting 
academic frills around a blatantly one-sided series of I-hate/dislike-
""them"", yesIdo,yesIdo,yesIdo. I did *not* find the approach of those 
opposing Davidsson to be centered *at all* on a denigration and denial
of the ""other side"". 

I certainly do wonder if the degree to which Davidsson's views on the 
Middle East have distorted is connected to his dislike and rejection
of his jewish lineage. Having said this, however, I agree with you that 
this constant accusing others of being ""self-hating"" jews seems
pointless. It is not worse a label than is ""why, you're on their side"",
except to perhaps imply a certain degree of overly enthusiastic 
biasedness.

BATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the all-sky map of
long-term sources.  Given that fact, and the spacecraft attitude knowledge
of approx. 2 arcmin, we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can

I disagree.  In the end, the *individual* is responsible for his/her own
irrationality.  The individual's belief in some dogmatic religion is a 
symptom of that irrationality.


Atheists and agnostics, I would imagine, but yes, that was my point.  An
atheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to study the philosophy
of religion as a Christian, and yet there is a persistence of atheists
among the ranks of philosophers.  Therefore, the conflict between one's
religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher
must not be as great as you assert.  The fact that most philosophers may
be non-religious was a secondary point.



As opposed to science practiced by theists?  Be careful here.

Science does have a built-in defence against faith and dogma:
skepticism.  Unfortunately, it is not foolproof.  There is that 
wonderful little creature known as the ""theory.""  Many of us believe in
the theory of evolution.  We have no absolute proof that this 
theory is true, so why do we believe it?  Because it ""makes more 
sense than...?""  There is quite a bit of faith involved here.



Well, not ALL current beliefs are deficient, but basically I agree.



Ideally, this is true.  In reality, though, you have to acknowledge
that scientists are human.  Scientists have egos and biases.  Some
scientists assume a particular theory is true, refuse to admit the
flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever, and proceed
to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof 
for the theory.  Remember cold fusion?



Not really.  I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco
crisis ($7,500,000 I believe), especially considering the outcome.
My point was that mass suicides in the U.S. are rare (Jonestown was
in Guyana, incidentally, although we footed the bill for the clean-up),
and the U.S. has far more important issues to address.  Compare the
number of U.S. citizens who have died in mass suicides with, say, the
number of U.S. soldiers who died during one week of the Vietnam War and
you will see my point.

        Interesting, as I think computer technology is now
becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position
which must require a degree.  I know of several people I work
with that make just as much as I do and they don't even have
a BS degree in comp sci. yet they make 28+ a year.  They also
didn't have to pay 30 grand to thier local University either. :(
       I think computer programming is being reduced to a trade
practice, than a truly specialty field.  It will be even more
so in the future.
       If your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you
choose CS as I did, I suggest checking out the emerging field
of Software Engineering.  The difficulties for example of designing
scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person
can handle 100,000 to 1,000,000 million lines of code all by himself
in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment

Since this is alt.atheism, I hope you don't mind if we strongly disagree...

: The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to. 
: But think about it for a minute.  Would you rather have someone love
: you because you made them love you, or because they wanted to
: love you.     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward
: Him.  He promises to be there for you, but you have to look for yourself.

Indeed, ""knock and it shall be opened to you"". Dan, why didn't this work?
I firmly believed in god for 15 years, but I eventually realised I was
only deluding myself, fearful to face the truth. Ultimately, the only reason
what kept me believing was the fear of hell. The mental states I 
had sillily attributed to divine forces or devil's attempts to 
destroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination, and it is easy
to achieve the same mental states at will. 

My faith was just learned fear in a disguise.

: Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort.

God is demanding too much. Dan, what was it I believed in for 15 years?
If sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief -
what it was in my case - I'd rather quit. If god does not help me to
keep the faith, I can't go on. 

Besides, I am concerned with god's morality and mental health. Does
she really want us to _believe_ in herself without any help (revelations,
guidance, or anything I can feel)? If she has created us, why didn't
she make the task any easier? Why are we supposed to love someone who
refuses to communicate with us? What is the point of eternal torture
for those who can't believe?

I love god just as much as she loves me. If she wants to seduce me,
she'll know what to do. 

: Simple logic arguments are folly.  If you read the Bible you will see
: that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with ""logic"".
: Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation.  Yet some think it is
: the ultimate.  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never
: know more than you do now. 

Your argument is of the type ""you'll know once you try"".
Yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried, and believed
for many years, but were eventually honest enough to admit that 
they had lived in a virtual reality.

What else but reason I can use? I don't have the spiritual means 
Christians often refer to. My conscience disagrees with the Bible.
I don't even believe I have a soul. I am fully dependent on my
body - indeed, I _am_ this body. When it goes up with flames, so
does my identity. God can entertain herself with copies of me
if she wants.

: To learn you must accept that which you don't know.

What does this mean? To learn you must accept that you don't know 
something, right-o. But to learn you must _accept_ something I don't
know, why? This is not the way I prefer to learn. It is unwise to
merely swallow everything you read. Suppose I write a book telling
how the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn (tm) has helped me in my
daily problems, would you accept this, since you can't know whether
it is true or not?

Note that the GIPU is also omnipotent, omnipresent, and loves just
about everyone. Besides, He (and She) is guiding every writer on this planet,
you and me, and not just some people who write legendary stories
2000 years ago.

Your god is just one aspect of His and Her Presence.

(Re: the newsgroup -- followups set to talk.politics.mideast where this
belongs.)

This may make the term 'civil war' dubious, but it does nothing to the
phrase 'destroy the government'. An occupying government is still a govern-
ment, and the Palestinians have made it quite clear that their goal is
not simply to prevent it from occupying the territories that don't con-
fer citizenship (which is your own determination of the distinction) but
to wipe it out entirely (and, not incidentally, the entire Jewish population
it rules with it). This is an intent to 'destroy the government', no
matter where the government happens to be from.


Wasn't a requirement for democracy in Athens. For that matter, isn't
a requirement for the term democracy in the United States, which doesn't
let non-citizens vote either. Both the United States and Israel have
processes whereby it is possible to acquire citizenship, with a great
deal of effort and a modicum of screening -- it's just that it isn't
automatic for living in the territories. It isn't automatic for living
in New York, either.

That said, suit yourself. Having never considered democracy the ultimate
in Good In This World, I could care less if you feel like calling Israel,
or America, or anywhere else, a democracy. Personally, I withhold the
term from Israel for the same reason I withhold it from Britain... the
parliamentary system is a serious handicap.


Again, suit yourself. In which case Israel is *not* attacking its own
people, it is fighting a war on foreign soil, in which case the residents
are entitled to play rough, yes -- but Israel's allowed to get just as
rough, within the bare limits of the rules of war. This includes, among
other things, the right to shoot or bomb *anyone* a national of the coun-
try in question who is fighting them (which permits mass frontal assault
on all rock-throwers), along with the right to take out any installation
of military importance (certain villages with too-good fortifications can
be handled by aerial bombing, as can waterways since they count as supply
lines to the enemy), and the right to do anything whatsoever to whatever
constitutes a government that they can lay hands on (if Hamas is trying
to set up as the ruling party, let them beware). 

If this is not the scenario you want, I recommend you go back to calling
it a civil war. Civil wars have to be handled nicer. You cannot say the
Palestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreign
nation and still call Israel a government who is treating its own people
cruelly. If the Palestinians are fighting a war against a foreign country,
so is Israel, and the gloves come *off*.

I guess that it was not acceptable because Germany *also* chose
a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of
other countries in peril. I wonder whether US or other countries
would have risked themselves if only Jews were persecuted and
Hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (I am no student of history
and I am just asking questions.)

If even for a moment you think that I am condoing ethnically
motivated violence and killings, you are dead wrong. Let me
assure I am not. My only question is this: Do powerful countries
have a moral obligation to interefere in other countries if
their own interests are not threatened. I cite an essay by
Charles Krauthammer in the Time (this week) that discusses
this issue eloquently.

For example, did US and other European countries abandon their
moral compunctions when they chose not to send military troops
to Bombay when Hindus, in a rare fit of impassioned rage, killed
many Muslims recently. I think not!

Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries,
is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious

"]To those of you who have the BMW heated handgrips:
]	Are they comfortable? Do they transmit a lot of
]	vibration? How do they compare to the stock grips?
]	To foam grips? 

I don't have the grips, but have looked into getting them. it's my 
understanding that the grips themselves are the standard european 
style grips now coming standard on the 93 bikes (K1100RS, K1100LT, etc).
it's also my understanding that the heater resides _inside_ the bar 
itself so if anything I would suspect it would reduce vibration by 
providing more bar end mass.

I don't see why they wouldn't work with the old style foam grips aside
from the fact that it might cause the foam to deteriorate or something.
hard to belive considering they do fine in the 100+ degree texas summers.

'course, I don't actually have them so you can save your flames.

That's fine idea, but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures.  For instance, a power company in Virginia 
recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various
type.  Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell
were bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus, you couldn't even buy
a good light from them.  In most places, to get a good light, you have to
either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At some
point, society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.  
Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code
down the lighting companies backs.  History seems to suggest that the latter
is more likely to work.

Agreed, so I won't respond again.  It's important for all you spacers out

#>#      Ah, that old chestnut, your claim that moral objectivism ==
#>#scientific objectivism. I don't agree with it; now try proving, through
#>#some objective moral test, that my disagreeing is incorrect. =)
#> 
#> Your claim, which you have deleted now was ""not universal => not objective"".
#
#      I've deleted it now, in the interest of brevity. Go back a step
#and you'll see it was still in your post. Yes, that was my claim; if you
#can refute it, then please do so.

Firstly, an apology.  You hadn't deleted your claim, and I was mistaken in
saying you had. Sorry for any offence caused.

Secondly,  how can I refute your definition?  I can only point up its
logical implications, and say that they seem to contradict the usage
of the word ""objective"" in other areas.  Indeed, by your definition, an
objective x is an oxymoron, for all x.  I have no quibble with that
belief, other than that it is useless, and that ""objective"" is a perfectly
good word.

#> So, what *is* objective?  Not the age of the universe, anyway, as I show
#> above.
#
#      How many ages can the universe have, and still be internally self-
#consistent? I'd be amazed if it was more than one. How many different
#moral systems can different members of society have - indeed, single
#individuals, in some cases - and humanity still stick together?

Begging the question.  People can have many opinions about the age
of the universe and humanity can still stick together.   You are
saying that the universe has a _real_ age, independent of my beliefs about
it.  Why?

#      The age of the universe, like most scientific facts, can be
#emirically verified through means that'll give the same result no matter
#who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the
#largish side...). 

This assumes that the universe has a real age, or any kind of reality
which doesn't depend on what we think.   Why should an extreme Biblical
Creationist give a rat's ass about the means of which you speak?

#I've heard of no way to verify morality in a
#consistent way, much less compute the errors of the measurement; care to
#enlighten me?

The same is true of pain, but painkillers exist, and can be predicted
to work with some accuracy better than a random guess.  I wrote
elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value.
If a moral system makes a prediction ""It will be better if..."",
that can be tested, and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction
""This drug will relieve pain...""

#      People's *ideas* about the age of object X are *not* objective;
#you can have any idea you like, and I can't stop you. Universae and
#their ages is another ballgame; they are what they are, and if you
#dislike some detail of them, that's a problem with your *opinion* of
#them. 

Sure.  Assume an objective reality, and you get statements like this.

#I claim that morality is an opinion of ours, and as such
#subjective and individual. If I'm wrong, then some more-or-less
#objectively ""real"" thing exists, which you label ""objective morality"";
#can you back up this positive claim of existence?

Can you back up your positive claim above?  No.  That's because it's an
assumption.  I make the same assumption about values, on the basis
that there is no logical difference between the two, and the empirical
basis of the two is precisely the same.

#>#      Point: Morals are, in essence, personal opinions. Usually
#>#(ideally) well-founded, motivated such, but nonetheless personal. The
#>#fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question,
#>#sometimes even for the same reason, does not make morals objective; it
#>#makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question,
#>#which can be good for the evolution of a social species.
#> 
#> And if a ""real large lot"" (nice phrase) of people agree that there is a

#
#      Take a look on the desk - i.e., perform a test. If(football) THEN

No. Just look.  Are you claiming never to know what good means?

By Lance Gay, Scripps-Howard News Service
 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- In this land of historic hatreds, a tiny
Jewish community is braving Serbian shells to repay a 50-year-old debt to
Muslims who saved Jews from the Holocaust.
 
Ivica Ceresnjes, president of the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, says he
and about 1,000 other Jews chose to remain in Sarajevo, rather than leave
for Israel, to keep a feeding center in the medieval old town district
running.
 
Ceresnjes said that was partly in gratitude to the Muslims who hid Jews during
the Nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuries-old presence of 
Jews living in Sarajevo.
 
``Some with guns are defending Bosnia, but I fight in Bosnia by keeping 
people alive,'' Ceresnjes said.
 
As a student of Balkan history, Ceresnjes said he saw this war coming and 
had ready plans to evacuate children and the elderly. A year before the war
erupted here last April, Ceresnjes said the Jewish center began
stockpiling supplies, ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for
places in Israel and Europe for the evacuees.
 
They were so well prepared, he said, that only five days after the
shooting began the first plane left. Of about 2,000 Jews in Bosnia-
Herzegovina, he estimates half have left. Many of those who stayed behind
work in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue, which has been turned into a
wartime feeding center that has so far given away 380,000 meals.
 
The center, which has been shelled several times along with most of
Sarajevo, also runs a radio station, mail center and distributes food
packages sent by Jewish organizations around the world.
 
While Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast, Jews here
say there's a long tradition of cooperation, inter-marriage and
tolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to
centuries of Turkish occupation.
 
Sarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman
Catholic Spain in 1492. The community numbered more than 14,000 before
World War II. But only 10% survived the Holocaust -- which was carried out
by the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia. Many of the survivors were
hidden by Muslim families in Mostar.

I am replying to this because I haven't seen anyone else do so yet. It
seems rather odd really as there are so few really wierd posters left
who aren't fascists or Arab extremists.


Yes it was and it was clearly admitted so by the troops who carried it
out and then stupidly deposited testimony in their own archives to that
effect.


Source? Noone is claiming this anymore except you. Would you like
to name one credible historian who asserts this? I believe that
even Begin has the decency not to claim this.


Yes they did and thye said so - they said they went their with the
intention of killing all the men and all the women who got in their
way. Their *own* archives remember, this is not hostile testimony.


Sound van bogged down in a ditch. No warning given.


Yes it was and no it was not. It was a massacre - the murder of hundreds
of unarmed civilians who had no part in the fighting. The surviving men
were taken to the local quarry and shot in the back of the head. Not
intentional? Yeah right.


No it did not - you have a source for this slander of course?


The men involved said clearly that the intention was to kill all the
men. It was a premeditated mass murder nothing else.


On that we agree at least.


Yes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed.
This is of course simple to resolve, the Haganah sent a soldier to report
on the massacre. He brought a photographer with him. He sent in a report.
The Israeli government suppressed it. Now the government was a Labour
Government. Since then the Revisionists have gotten into power but for
some reason Likud didn't release the report and its pictures either.
Perhaps you might want to tell me why? If it happened as you claim then
there will be no pictures of men shot in the head with their hands tied
behind their backs, no women and children shot as they slept. Yet for
some reason they did not take the chance to clear their own name. You
have a reason for this don't you? I somehow doubt it. The facts are
exactly as the people responsible claim - a premeditated mass murder
nothing else. No Iraqi soldiers, no other fighting. Just ethnic cleansing
at work.

It has ultra-high reliability and extremely

Cost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less. Also, in most 
instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more 
performance. I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on.
The mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at 
2-3K rpm. After talking to Kaz Yoshima, the developer and manufacturer of 
the slip on, he thinks I might need larger pilot, idle, jets. Was not suppose
to but maybe where I live makes a difference. Altitude, barometric pressure...
Anyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound,
which is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks. The Ontario 
slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full 
throttle.

Just remember, every bike is a tuned system. When you change the intake or
exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer, you may
have to change other areas to compensate. Like a complete change of the exhaust
system, header and muffler, changes the exhaust characteristic to the point
which re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping
profile.

Talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if
they have used it on your particular bike. Check with people who have the
system also to see what they think about there slip on.

Also, as a last data point, in Sport Rider's first issue, did a review on a
group of header and exhaust systems for the CBR600F2. They also included, as a 
side bar, the Ontario slip on, the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at
the rear wheel, 85 verses 91.

#
#This is still contradictory. It reduces to
#
#  (1): Alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to [benefactor or bug].
#
#  (2): this is not evidence for [benefactor], neither is it evidence for
#       [bug] (meaning that it doesn't lend more weight to one than to the
#       other)
#
#  (3): therefore no evidence can exist for [benefactor] and no evidence
#       can exist for [bug].
#
#But (3) relies on a shift in meaning from (2). When you say (paraphrased)
#in (2) that this is not ""evidence for [benefactor]"", for example, what you
#mean is that it's no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].

Yes, that's what I mean.

#so that it now means `absolute' ""evidence for [benefactor]"" rather than
#`relative' ""evidence for [benefactor]"" w.r.t. [bug].

Not really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I
think this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say,
in my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates
to theism making predictions (prayer, your 'Rapture' example), I don't
buy your use of Occam's razor in all cases where A=0.

In my example, one couldn't dismiss
[benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary
to explain the dosh.  I brought up the 'one-by-one dismissal' process to
show that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you're saying in this
post, it seems you agree, and we're talking at cross-purposes.

#(3) is still in contradiction to (1).
#
#Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:
#
#  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1
#
#Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it's either the benefactor *or* a bug
#which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then
#
#   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)
#
#so
#
#   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1
#
#but (3) implies that
#
#   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.

No, this isn't what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with
necessarily no new observation (we've already seen the dosh) to change
those estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that
it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that's
precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are
one class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of
hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise 
would _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or
retained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   
Alternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds
that the answer can't be known, or that the notional probability estimates
are effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).

#> As they do when the set M is filled by ""the universe is caused by x"",

#
#Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we don't ""throw out"" any of
#these, contrary to your assertion above that we do.

Some people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science.
My sole point was that they aren't.

#>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x

I was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.

#
#On the contrary, those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which

#thread.

Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If
the razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which
means that you're assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we've already
established that it's not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over
all i.

#Although that doesn't, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case
#(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al).
#
#But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is

No, I got that.  I'm talking about the case when A=0.  You're clearly
correct when A!=0.   And I'm not constructing a strawman (though it's
certainly possible that I've misunderstood what you're saying).  However,
by any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,
and when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting
to be an inductive proof that gods either don't exist, or are unnecessary
to explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this
(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain
a fallacy upon close examination.  If that's not what you're saying, then
please put me straight.",0

  >So how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolled 
  >back the Iraqi invasion, were you in charge of Saudi Arabia??? 
  
  All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq, not 
  to ""Liberate Kuwait"", The people who were killed by the invasion are 
  more (many many more), than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis 
  in their smaller invasion. I lived in the west, and I have seen how 
  your media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against 
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
No doubt you plan on exploiting ""helpless naive Americans"" for your own
purposes. Hmm...let's see: 

  Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that 
  led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to 
  be surprised not to know). 
  It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid. 

  What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis   over 
  200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen 
  if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct 
  or indirect result of western envolvement. 

Possibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based on
Greenpeace estimates.  Greenpeace had compromised its alleged
impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental
consequences of Allied miiltary action, while initially *completely*
ignoring Iraq's horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumping
of millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of
over 700 oil wells.  What is the real number?  There has been a lot of
work on this in the last two years, none of it reported as the
Greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about.  The real
number seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number of
Kuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation.  I've
included an article I recently posted below, but this is really old
news.  Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 only
a few months after the war, but it was hardly reported. 

For the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis, they would have had to
kill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait. 

The favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at
Mutla'.  This was yet another example of the American and European media
playing into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     The
destruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla' was portrayed as an all-out
slaughter.  This is simply not true.  The head and tail of the convoy
was bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points. 
 Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled
on foot. 

Furthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn't invaded
is completely ridiculous.  You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly) 
 that Saddam is a barbarous brute.  You have acknowledged the hundreds
of thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*. 
You *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait,  Ali Majid,
was his most brutal henchman, presiding over the near genocide of the
Kurds  in the late 80's and, more recently, the Shi'a.    Yet, when it
comes to his treatment of Kuwaitis, he is an angel.  In your estimate,
he would've killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started. 
What a joke!

data reductions. I remember one person in particular who passionately declared
that the data was completely wrong as there were no explanation for the
phenomena of the smooth sky distribution. (heck it even shoots down the
warp transition theory :(. The next conference is soon and I will endeavour
to keep in touch with this fun subject.",3

"I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here
on the net.  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this
group, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would
seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and
mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.  

First of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a
variety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give 
succinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of 
you typing for hours, I'm sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean 
it) is great, but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of 
individuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing
-- it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.  

Secondly, I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious; I know that
phrases like ""What would convince you of the existence of God"" imply that I am
a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens.
In fact, I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my
use of ""God"" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it's easier 
than just repeating ""a deity or higher power"" every time.  

Also, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like ""belief system""
although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs, but
are skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean.
Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases 
required to get the precise idea across.  

Lastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as
you can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.  

---------------

Where would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum 
	Theism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?  
Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.  


In what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe 
in the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume 
that the answer to this is ""yes;"" if you've always been an atheist, or at
least never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)


How serious was your/your family's involvement?  

How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?  

How and when did your ""final break"" with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I 
realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an ""event"" per se;
whatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.  


What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)
your ""conversion"" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism
counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)  

To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your
beliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through
independent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  


Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational
means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least 
in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  


To what extent do you feel you ""understand"" the universe through your beliefs?
What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical
phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you 
feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as 
an explanatory method?  

What would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would
convince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the 
plausibility of God's existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs
-- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for
some time?  

Are you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you
think science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science
was the new ""secular religion,"" and that ""scientists are, in a very real sense,
the new priesthood.""  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi-
religious base, or even a religious element?)  

---------------

This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but
also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose
ideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have
me, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your
beliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.

Thanks again.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what
I'm doing with this data, or if you have anything to say in addition to what
I've asked about above.  ",0

Wow! You got me thinking now!

This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a 
move in society to classify previously ""socially unacceptable"" yet legal 
activities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two 
coexisting methods of social control.

First (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of 
actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set 
of punishments.

Secondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are 
the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered 
by legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if 
socialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed 
since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of 
social censure.

The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as ""guilt"" and 
""morality"".  I've heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren't for 
the VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be 
absolutely impossible.

Lately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to 
attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain't 
illegal, then don't pick on me).  I'm not saying this is wrong, merely 
that it is a byproduct of a society which has:

	1) A high education level,
	2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media,
	3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and
	4) A ""me"" oriented culture.

I guess what I'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition, 
here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\
can't allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we 
are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as 
those freedoms don't impinge on another's.

IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we 
appreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old 
territoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, 
inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the 
continued destabilization of society.  

I got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this 
mess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms 
in order to ""stabilize"" society.  Yet I believe development of societies 
follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a 
social model which maximizes indiv. freed.'s yet is stable?  Perhaps it is 
possible to live with a ""non-stable"" society?

Anybody see a way out?  Comments?

PS.  Therefore answer to question #3:  We don't.  Do we want to?

Ahh, perhaps that's why we've (astronomers) have just built *2* 10-meter
ground-based scopes and are studying designs for larger ones.
Seriously, though, you're never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit
as cheaply as you can build one on the ground, and with adaptive optics
and a good site, the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit
anyway.  Also, scopes in low orbit (like Hubble) can only observe things
continuously for ~45 minutes at a time, which can be a serious
limitation.


I sure as hell does if the 'point of light' is half a degree in extent
and as bright as the moon.  Have you ever noticed how much brighter the
night sky is on a moonlit night?



Existing satellites *are* points of light, but an advertising sign that
appeared as a point would be useless, so I rather think these will
appear larger than a 'typical' satellite.  Also, satellite tracks *are*
ruining lots of plates in the current Palomar Sky Survey.

"Thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my 
question about which countries engage in space surveillance. 
Unfortunately, I apparently didn't make the meaning of the message 
clear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance, 
rather than space surveillance 

     What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at 
the Earth (satellite reconnaissance) , but _was_ which countries have 
programs to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of) 
satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance). 

    The US uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating 
quasi-radar operated by the Navy, to do this for satellites in LEO, and 
electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so. 
The FEE, I understand, does much the same thing. 

    Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches 
and PCs for objects out to around 1500 km, enabling them to keep track 
of satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren't available. 
See the fascinating books by Desmond King-Hele for details, as well as 
the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov.  The 
material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in 
optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be 
that other countries do also. 

    Which was the question I meant to ask: who are they, how do they do 
it, and why do they do it?

   Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge

   isn't a mechanism for the others either.

What on Earth is the ""gravisphere""?
Anyway, before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter
had a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they 
detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors
do, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances.
In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would
see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin.

_The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have

This occurs when one party points out that some source of information takes
stand A, which is inconsistent with B.  There are two variations in which B is
either a mutually-agreed-on premise or else a stand elsewhere from the same
source.  The second party fallaciously responds by saying ""see, the source
really does say B, it's right here!""; this reply does not refute the allegation
of inconsistency because it does not show that the source _only_ says B.

Example of the first type: ""The Koran says unbelievers should be treated in
these ways.  We can both agree these are immoral.""  ""The Koran clearly says in
this other passage that unbelievers are not to be treated that way.""

The problem with turing your computer on and off constantly is not due to
the power surge at start up.  It is due to thermal fatigue.  You turn on
your computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it
cools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles
of this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics
are much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact
portable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function
that extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal
cycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my
computer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it
off (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the

Let me improve this one for you, then. For nearly one thousand years, 
the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last 
one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The 
persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and 
carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks 
and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. 
After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks
and Kurds. 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its 
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity.

x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims 
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands,
to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

...On this occasion, we once again reiterate the unquestioned 
justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and...

- We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its 
responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, render 
reparations to the Muslim people, and return the land to its 
rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an 
issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that 
artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.

- We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States 
that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, adopts 
the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures 
to the contrary.

- As taxpayers of the United States, we express our vehement 
protest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued 
coddling, protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet
Armenia.

- Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia's.

""Muslim"" in ex-Yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  In fact, not
all Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam.  Therefore, there do (did?)
exist in ex-Yugoslavia ""Christian Muslims.""  Tito defined the Muslim 
nation constitutionally, adding Muslims to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes,
the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the
end of WWI.  In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally:
Montenegrins, and Makedonijans. 

Nations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  So, ""Muslim""
is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who 
differentiate between religion and politics, that is) in B-H.  It was not 
a ""Christo-Slavic"" ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia, it
was the ""Atheist Communist"" ideology of Tito.  Before Tito, there was
no Muslim nation in Yugoslavia.  

The war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war.  It is a
civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
instead of pens.  The Croat, Muslim, and Serb political leaders *all*
chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements. ",4

You are not sticking to the original question. Imagine what it
would be like if you were human...impossible you say?



Is that not the crux of my argument? Why is this so difficult
for you to understand? Lack of intelligence?



Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, 
the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated 
in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion
and national origin?

1) Armenians did slaughter the entire Muslim population of Van.[1,2,3,4,5]
2) Armenians did slaughter 42% of Muslim population of Bitlis.[1,2,3,4]
3) Armenians did slaughter 31% of Muslim population of Erzurum.[1,2,3,4]
4) Armenians did slaughter 26% of Muslim population of Diyarbakir.[1,2,3,4]
5) Armenians did slaughter 16% of Muslim population of Mamuretulaziz.[1,2,3,4]
6) Armenians did slaughter 15% of Muslim population of Sivas.[1,2,3,4]
7) Armenians did slaughter the entire Muslim population of the x-Soviet
   Armenia.[1,2,3,4]

I disagree with what to tout, although I agree that the space program is
inherently a good thing.  Most people today only care about ""what will it
cost me?"" and ""what's in it for me?"" and could care less about whether
something is simply worthwhile in and of itself.  Our society has become
increasingly geared toward the short-term (which you could read as NOW!). 
They couldn't care less about next week, much less next century.  They want
something to show for the expenditure and they want it *now*.

I think we *should* tell them about the things that they are using now that
are spinoffs of the space program.  That is the only way you can *prove*
its worth to *them* - and they vote and pay taxes too.  The continued
existence of the space program relies upon that money.

"Here's the scoop:

For the past two years, I have been using an SE/30 with a Sony 1304s and
a Lapis video card.  This past month, I bought a Quadra 800 and am now 
using the Sony on it.  My SE/30 has been shipped home to my father who
is planning on getting an Apple 14"" monitor (The Trinitron one).  My
question is this:  What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple
monitor.  Does it come with two types?  As I recall, one can hook up the
power cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my 
Quadra 800.  However, for my father's SE/30, there is no extra plug which
allows use of the SE/30's power supply.  He needs to plug it into the
socket separately.  So...does the monitor come with a cable that will allow
him to do this?  Will have to buy a different cable?  IF yes, where can he
purchase such a cable? or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables?

"This is maybe not a Pet Peeve, but definitely a Playmate Peeve:


Does this make anyone's Skeptic Alarm (tm) go off?  No offense, Bill, I
don't mean to say that you're not being straight, but I wonder how you
know about this?  Have you actually every used your secret method to break
all the different kinds of bike locks?  Or are you taking someone's word
for it?

The fact is, it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to
go into a successful bike-stealing business because they read anything in
rec.motorcycles.  So please tell us what you are talking about.  We can't
even protect against an assault, or discuss methods, if you don't come out
with it.

See, I have heard the ones about the pipes, and the liquid nitrogen, and the
cordless Dremel tools, and a bunch of other ones.  The most plausable method
(I am not a bike thief, so I really don't know for certain) is just to put
a rod through each wheel, and use four guys to just lift the bike into a
truck.  This works because most people don't lock their bikes TO anything.
Since that method is so childishly easy, I figure a nice, visible chain or
cable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on
to the next bike.

(Hey, finally an advantage to the weight and high CG of the Concours!  :-)


What tactic are you referring to?  If we don't know what you are talking about,
we can't very well guard against it, can we?

For my money (literally) I rely on a combination of a motion-detector alarm
with pager when I'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area, C&C
insurance, and I try to park in obvious, visible areas with lots of people
about.  (See, if someone just plays with the bike without intention of
stealing it, at least some eyes are on it, and if they get too rambunctious,
they'll set off the alarm.)

That's for a nice bike.  For a ratbike, the trick is to always keep its
actual value well below blue-book, so that it looks so crappy nobody would
WANT to steal it, and even if they were stupid enough to, you would make
a profit on the deal.  :-)

Seriously, if I (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week,
and (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting, they both get a shitty-looking,
but useable cover, locked on, and both bikes locked to each other and a
curb bumper in the parking lot under the light.  I usually rig the cable
locks I use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or
the cable joining them, the Concours alarm goes off.  And I have a friend
come buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there.  The
only thing I have ever had stolen was a $60 cover, and that was over 
winter storage, with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm).

Oh, put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through, and
place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off.

That's the best that I can think of.  Most of the locks I see people put
on bikes look, well, not too mechanically sound.  I like ABUS, since I have
personally removed Master locks from lockers with my boot.",2
"FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
                       by Robert E. McElwaine, Physicist
          
               Ninety to a hundred years ago, everybody ""knew"" that a 
          heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly.  It would 
          violate the ""laws"" of physics.  All of the ""experts"" and 
          ""authorities"" said so. 
          
               For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  ""The 
          demonstration that no possible combination of known 
          substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of 
          force, can be united in a practical machine by which man 
          shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer 
          as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any 
          physical fact to be."" 
          
               Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright 
          Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final 
          word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they 
          crash). 
          
               Today, orthodox physicists and other ""scientists"" are 
          saying similar things against several kinds of 'Free Energy' 
          Technologies, using negative terms such as ""pseudo-science"" 
          and ""perpetual motion"", and citing so-called ""laws"" which 
          assert that ""energy cannot be created or destroyed"" (""1st law 
          of thermodynamics"") and ""there is always a decrease in useful 
          energy"" (""2nd law of thermodynamics"").  The physicists do not 
          know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare 
          that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF 
          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern ""science"" and help to 
          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox 
          modern theories. 
          
               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a 
          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-
          OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT 
          SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated 
          pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment. 
          
               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy, 
          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by 
          various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices, 
          they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they 
          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy 
          has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by 
          clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced 
          by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and 
          high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and 
          often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are 
          suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly 
          designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations. 
          
               For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058, 
          #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for 
          motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly 
          tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic 
          field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to 
          be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in 
          ""Science & Mechanics"" magazine, Spring 1980, (""Amazing 
          Magnet-Powered Motor"", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117, 
          and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes, 
          orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such 
          a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible 
          heatpump in one's home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.  [Complete

               A second type of free-energy device, such as the 'Gray 
          Motor' (U.S. Patent #3,890,548), the 'Tesla Coil', and the 
          motor of inventor Joseph Newman [see SCIENCE, 2-10-84, pages 
          571-2.], taps ELECTRO-MAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from 
          'EARTH RESONANCE' (about 12 cycles per second plus 
          harmonics).  They typically have a 'SPARK GAP' in the circuit 
          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the 
          energy being tapped.  It is important that the total 
          'inductance' and 'capacitance' of the Device combine to 
          'RESONATE' at the same frequency as 'EARTH RESONANCE' in 
          order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be 
          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the 'NEUTRAL CENTER' 
          of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a 
          Tesla Coil, slipping a 'TOROID CHOKE COIL' around the 
          secondary coil will enhance output power.  [""Earth Energy: 
          Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems"", by John Bigelow, 1976, 
          Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.] 
          
               During the 1930's, an Austrian civil engineer named 
          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an 
          'IMPLOSION TURBINE' (German name, 'ZOKWENDLE'), after 
          analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped 
          waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical 
          equations to explain it.  As described in the book ""A 
          Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources"", by Dan A. Davidson, 
          1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a 
          LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a 
          CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer 
          touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump, 
          which then converts the pump's motor into an ELECTRIC 
          GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that 
          of the earth's rotation, via the 'Coriolis effect', LIKE A 
          TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ] 
          
               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the 'McClintock 
          Air Motor' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between 
          a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression 
          ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and 
          planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running 
          by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also 
          generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat 
          buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large 
          trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.  
          [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the 
          automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.] 
          
               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown 
          in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between 
          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of 
          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a 
          common household smoke detector. 
          
               One other energy source should be mentioned here, 
          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free 
          Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph 
          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION 
          reactor which he calls 'Migma', which uses NON-radioactive 
          deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities 
          from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be 
          converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting 
          steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power 
          a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the 
          ""Tokamaks"" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about, 
          Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power 
          for every watt put in.  [""New Times"" (U.S. version), 6-26-78, 
          pages 32-40.] 
          
               And then there are the 'cold fusion' experiments that 
          have been in the news lately, originally conducted by 
          University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin 
          Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake 
          Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of 
          chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the 
          bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with 
          mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which 
          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough 
          of it to explain the excess heat generated. 
          
               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called ""laws"" 
          of thermodynamics are NOT so ""absolute"".  For example, the 
          late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he 
          calls the 'Reciprocal System', (which he describes in detail 
          in several books such as ""Nothing But Motion"" (1979) and ""The 
          Universe of Motion"" (1984)), in which the physical universe 
          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter 
          half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing 
          between them, with-OUT the ""heat death"" predicted by 
          thermodynamic ""laws"".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH 
          BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena 
          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching 
          their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some 
          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow, 
          seemingly converting ""low-quality energy"" into ""high-quality 
          energy"". 
          
               Also, certain religious organizations such as 'Sant Mat' 
          and 'Eckankar' teach their Members that the physical universe 
          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of 
          existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV 
          channels, as described in books like ""The Path of the 
          Masters"", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and ""Eckankar: The Key 
          to Secret Worlds"", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example, 
          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly 
          called the 'Astral Plane'.  Long-time Members of these groups 
          have learned to 'Soul Travel' into these higher worlds and 
          report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy 
          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical 
          universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given 
          the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is 
          supported by many successful laboratory-controlled 
          experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as 
          those described in the book ""Psychic Discoveries Behind the 
          Iron Curtain"". 
          
               In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors 
          do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop 
          and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional 
          energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their 
          VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If 
          the government does not intervene, then the total supply of 
          energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and 
          will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and 
          pollution and its harmful effects (including the 'GREENHOUSE 
          EFFECT', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil 
          spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue 
          to increase. 
          
               The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development 
          of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize 
          private production (until the producers can make it on their 
          own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of 
          Free Energy Hardware. 
          
               The long-range effects of such government intervention 
          would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy 
          demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining 
          companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$, 
          etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to 
          seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil, 
          and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for 
          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero, 
          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high 
          but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR's, 
          personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that 
          require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease, 
          along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be 
          able to realize the ""opportunity costs"" of paying electric 
          utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would 
          benefit and increase because travelers would not have to 
          spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government 
          tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be 
          obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE 
          USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR. 
          
               Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of 
          business, but society as a whole, and the earth's environment 
          and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People, 
          that government should serve, rather than the big 
          corporation$ and bank$.

"THe origional bit is missing but long/short follows:

    The origional poster asked if he/she could use any old vga/svga
monitor with a centris (hence title).  

    The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes.  You can use any
old vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a
Mac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two
machines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a
three row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.

    NOW, the special interest disclaimer.
 The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400
resolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above
adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my
1604s).

THen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would
advocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As
to the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because
they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.
    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN
CONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU
TO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND
THEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.

personal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers
doesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to
find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the
sync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits
(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most
favorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a
specialized application video card).(i.e. ""well you can get a resolution
1168x832 on this $5,  9"" ""super smelly sock"" monitor that will let you
display TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably
priced ""oder eater"" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an
ultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz
vertical."")



Note:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video
board using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the
sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as
possible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an
inch.",1
"I used to hate it when people posted messages like this, but now that I
am contemplating a purchase, I can see why they do.

So, has anyone heard of any upcoming (within the next 6 months)
advances in the Powerbook line?  Can we expect to see a PowerPC
PowerBook at some point in the future (I assume an 040 would take too
much power and generate too much heat for installation in a PowerBook)?",1
"
So is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on
its side horizontally?

I got a drive a few years ago with the rubber feet on the side,
etc. and have used it like that since (obviously designed for that
orientation). However, it doesn't fit under any of the clever
places I can think of to place it, so I would really like to lay it
flat and put it under a low shelf.

This is probably not a ""newer"" drive, and it is only 70 meg, but
when I bought it, it was a large drive for an average user
(comparable to buying a 200 meg drive today). So is my old, 70 meg
drive as fragile (or not) as a new 200 meg drive?

Just curious.....

A typical Armenian revisionist. As in the past in x-Soviet Armenia, 
and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians
brought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced
nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods
the Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual,
they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag 
is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with 
no border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides 
the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and 
the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan, which 
renders the Armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic. No one in his or 
her mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event 
could have plagued the Azeris. One cannot even imagine the reverse case 
to occur, for the Armenians either would have slaughtered the Azerbaijanis, 
or put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. Where was she?


                An Appeal to Mankind

During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational
population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of
the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights
guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,
documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.

The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan
though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to
guarantee life and peace.

The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's
tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against
Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied
and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.

Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly
deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.
Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also
been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.
Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives 
of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central
Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.

One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific
experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection 
of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.

We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,
for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are
violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,
its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of
Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over 
the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the
USSR and the United States. 

One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent 
events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on
Azerbaijan.

It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the
issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly
and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their
representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan
SSR.

We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we 
are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one
of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic 
Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.

But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the
Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists
encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000
Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the 
neighboring lands.

The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,
suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.

But what about the lives of seven million human beings?
If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are
less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their 
colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other
attributes?

All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal
of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous
appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

""PAINFUL SEARCH ..""

THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians
in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about
600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the
four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.

The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials
and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid
workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.

The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of
the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control
of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations
in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting
retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the
dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first
suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.
Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken
Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000
dead.

The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a
15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  ""Hojali
Disaster"", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on
preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman
Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in
the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more
than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700
dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman
of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.

FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International
Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of
Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque
from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. ""We  did  not count  the
bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,"" Mr
Zen Ruffinen said. ""We have some idea since we gave the body bags
and products to wash the dead.""

Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the
number of  dead in the  massacre. ""Don't  get worked up.  It will
take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,"" the  43-year-old
lawyer said at his small office.

Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to
reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714
wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist
uprising in Baku in January 1990.

Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power
three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly
what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70
miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.

Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being
the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the
republic's forensic department. ""This  is just a small percentage
of the dead,"" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic
scientist. ""They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the
chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury
our dead within 24 hours.""

Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14
years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and
axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland
snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of
deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises
cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's
report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those
believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.

Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still
disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six
policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the
names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The
most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far
comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a
helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27
February.

""There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to
count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream
and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,"" Mr
Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter
pilot.

""People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and
one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was
pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but
Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to
return.""

There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in
circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few
months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali
at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
taken over by Armenian forces.

HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES

AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the
Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in
his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of
Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.

""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,""
the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the
Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to
be alive.""

Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity
for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12
days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the
2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the
edge of Karabakh.

""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard
before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy
machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said.

Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction
of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started
fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the
snow into a forest on the other side.

To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam
about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,
until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two
Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.

""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by
a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening
fire,"" Mr Sadikov said.

Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward
to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts
were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his
group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman
son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his
67-year-old elder brother.

""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,""
he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We
have never got any of the bodies back.""

The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.
One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he
struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's
crossing, Mr Sadikov said.

Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and
several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy
hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three
Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.

As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was
little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was
soon to flee.

""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian
rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I
had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.
They even found a bullet in my sock.""

relatives in  the town of Agdam  (right) weep over the  coffin of
another of the massacre victims. Calculating the final death toll
has been  complicated because Muslims  bury their dead  within 24
hours.

"I appeal to to all of you to show up in Washington DC. this saturday to
participate in a peaceful demonstration for the sake of humanity!! This is a 
critical point in the history of world and we can make a change otherwise things
will not change there in Bosnia.. Rapes/killings/ethnic cleansing will
go on as a norm in the days to follow. The UN will get to the towns after the fall
of thousands of inocent civilians (like in Zapa just the past weekend!). It happened
to the Jews in 1940's, it's happening to the muslims today and who will be the next
victim??

Since the Europeans want to remain indifferent in this issue, time has come for US to
take a leadership role to stop these crimes against humanity. Time is now and
this is for real folks, the people of New England Bosnian Relief Committee seriously believe
that Clinton's Adminstration will stop supporting the Bosnian cause without sustained
public pressure. I just called Democaratic Sen. John Kerry's office and they are saying that 
he (the senator) is waiting for president to take a decision, means that he will wait and 
join the band-wagon later if it ever moves! 

Please don't rely on others to take part in this demonstration -You as an individual
will make a big difference. Bring your families too, not only you will help a great
cause but also it will be fun for all. I know of several families from Massachusetts
who are travelling friday night to participate there. Contact the local Islamic center
or Bosnia relief agency if you want to travel by pre-arranged busses. The best option 
for students is to rent-a-car and car-pool. Please, spread the word around...

You should have heard Prof. McNally , from my days as an astronomy
undergraduate, denouncing photon pollution. It was easy to imagine him
taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street
outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-)

However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects of
streetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light only
illuminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As a
bonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination level
is reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected
local authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable
success in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At
least, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago.
( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see )

I suppose that the ""right"" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration,
but it is a worthwhile one. Illuminated orbital billboards seem especially
yukky, and are presumably in the area of international law, if any, although
I do find the idea of a right to bear anti-satellite weapons intriguing.",3

Sure about that? Maybe Proxima might cause problems, but at Oort

Besides, even the solar system's Oort cloud is unstable over

else, like the short period comets of the Kupier Belt?

Until we're able to perform a broad-band survey of nearby stars

bring this up here is that there are **many** from middle eastern

element to any consideration of ""resolution"" of the Arab-Israel
conflict.


You explained what ""sea"" meant with regard to the Israelis/jews,
please do so in this case.


""Just""? You better not ask for that because that would mean North

would take back their lands from the Islamic invaders, the Saxons get 
to kick the Normans out of the UK, the central and south american 
tribes get to kick the spanish descendents out of thier lands..... 
And, once we have returned the land to those who last possessed it, 
we have to find out from whom **they** stole it. At some point, *every* 
culture stole the land they are on from previous occupants.


But wait! Now you refer to ""Palestinians"", so what happened to ""Gaza""?

As we both know, most people would choose the third alternative. And,
since you have done so in the past, perhaps you would initiate things by 
presenting your vision of ""resolution"". In doing so, however, the worries
(not paranioas, *worries*) and resonable expectations **of both**

speed star competition as their first skydive.

}This person is <100 lbs. and fairly small, so I don't see weight as too much
}of a problem, but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go?
}I want her to hold onto me  :-)   rather than the grab rail out back, and
}I've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we're
}turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional

1) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension, adjust it to a stiffer
setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves.

2) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are:

a) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down. Not when you stop at a STOP
sign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the
pegs until you tell her to get off the bike.

b) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough
that she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And
(added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as
possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your
balls up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this.

c) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't
lean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular.
Don't look over your shoulder.*

3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That
means don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than
usual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have
the equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind,
so be prepared for that.

4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't
have to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself.

5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things
of interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get
so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it gives
her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at.

* My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended ""look over the rider's
shoulder in curves"" bit, and it just didn't work. The timing of
her weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because,
unlike the Ninja, the upright riding position really restricts the
pillion's view of the road ahead). Next time I had her just remain
perpendicular to the bike, and I could hardly tell there was someone
else on the bike in curves, and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs.",2

#That's a fallacy, and it is not the first time it is pointed out.

It's not a fallacy - note the IF.   IF a supermajority of disinterested people 
agree on a fundamantal value (we're not doing ethics YET Benedikt), then what 
is the difference between that and those people agreeing on a trivial
observation?

#For one, you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. Unlike
#a football. Further, you conveniently ignore here that there are
#many who would not agree on tghe morality of something. The analogy
#does not hold.

I have, however, given an example of a VALUE people agree on, and explained
why.  People will agree that their freedom is valuable.  I have also
stated that such a value is a necessary condition for doing objective
ethics - the IF assertion above.  And that is what I'm talking about, there
isn't a point in talking about ethics if this can't be agreed.

#One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football,
#while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees
#with a set of morals YOU have to give.

I'm not doing morals (ethics) if we can't get past values.  As I say,
the only cogent objection to my 'freedom' example is that maybe people
aren't talking about the same thing when they answer that it is valuable.
Maybe not, and I want to think about this some, especially the implications
of its being true.

#Further, the above is evidence, not proof. Proof would evolve out of testing
#your theory of absolute morals against competing theories.

Garbage.  That's not proof either.

#The above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer

I disagree.  It think the average joe is interested/curious about spaceflight
but sees it as an elitist activity.  Not one which he is ever going to
participate in.


Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details
of long term space habitation?  I like the idea of the study, but it should
be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it.
If you want a general public document, you'll need a more general publication.


As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems, engineering
the microworld isn't the problem.  The problem is understanding the basic
chemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them
efficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from
plants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we have
to orbit a farm.  Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use 
technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of 
using dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologies
bring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to.  Like, in 
dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in 
hydroponics it turns out that you can't do that.  The lettuce growth is 
stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So 
now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar
interactions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that's
what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far.
We also need to find out how they interact together.  That's where we are now.


First you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of information
out there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation.
This could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net.  Then
we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.


Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net,
I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search 
first.  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis.  The data
base itself could be useful for future engineers.

between some software cracks...


[Here follows an introduction to the controversial incident, and an
 apologetic explanation purporting to show why it couldn't actually
 have happened.  The historicity of the episode doesn't matter to what
 follows]

I don't know whether I'm quoting Gregg or Zakaria below.  Anyway, back
to current affairs,


Among others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone
else dug up from nowhere, it is a well known story, a myth if you
will, known (according to Umar Khan) to ""Every Muslim school boy and
girl"", and so presumably to Rushdie, and to Gibreel Farishta.


Yes, this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing
about a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing
the actor ""Gibreel"" in the role of the angel whose name he took.
Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims
or implies that this is what actually happened.  It's somewhat like
stories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed
prostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the
Arthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens
of others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,
consider Salman Rushdie's children's book ""Haroun and the Sea of
Stories"" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific
storyteller -- works with existing story lines.


No.  Muhammad's [Mahound's] integrity is not really impugned in this
part of the story, and there's no reason to think this was Rushdie's
intent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and
satanic), though he doesn't know their provenance.  It is not implied
(in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:

    "" *Not my voice* I'd never know such words I'm no classy speaker
    never was never will be but this isn't my voice it's a Voice.
      Mahound's eyes open wide, he's seeing some kind of vision,
    staring at it, oh, that's right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He's
    seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don't
    know, can't say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my
    mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.
      Being God's postman is no fun, yaar.
      Butbutbut: God isn't in this picture.
      God knows whose postman I've been.""

It's ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan?
Or something else?  The answer is not given.

To be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the
role of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss
of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,
but this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very
existence of a newsgroup named ""alt.atheism"" raises the same
questions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is
the real relevance.  If Rushdie's mild fictional exploration is ""filth
and lies"", and he ""asked for what he got"", are we next on the fatwa
list?  (That's a rhetorical question, of course.)

"Unable to stand the pain anymore, my wife bought the Corbin Gunfighter

It came with no instructions, but it came 2 weeks earlier than they
said it would.  Installation would have been very easy, but the seat
fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with
the stock seat!  It never was easy to put on.  Once I figured that
out, the new seat went on the first try.  The passenger backrest, though,
does not fit as I thought it might.  The supplied screw to set the 
backrest angle does not fit, and I have not yet found a suitable, 
hard, ( SAE grade 8, or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits.  There is a
a soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back.

The driver's section of the seat is a bit wider.  Seems comfortable
enough, but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat
without a thought.  The passenger's section has about 8 times the 
volume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it
seems much more comfortable.  The backrest helps a bit, but I've not

So how much mass is saved by not burning the OMS?  That's the critical question.
My data shows that the OMS engines hold 10,900 kg of propellant.  Of that, a 
substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn, the reentry
burn and the reserve.  So Pat, tell us how much fuel the altitude change is
going to take, and how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1 and extra parts are going
mass.  If you can make the numbers work out, _then_ I'll be interested.  After
you show us that it can be done, then tell us how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1
and extra equipment is going to cost.  




First, while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning, that was
because they _had_ to.  They don't like to do that as a general rule.

Second, remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat 6?  They were trying
to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn't designed to do that.  
Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely.

Third, they don't have eight months.  They have however much time is left 
after someone comes up with a plan, shows it can work and gets it approved.
You may think I have a pessimistic attitude.  I think it's realistic.  I'm not
saying that the engineering task is impossible (few engineering tasks are).  
What I'm saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA
management.



""All they have to do is soup it up?""  Just what does that mean?  




The second servicing mission is a contingency.  You have neither shown that it
would be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your
plan.  


No, Pat, I haven't forgotten.


No Pat.  That's $500 million minus the cost of the new hardware, minus the cost
of the extra struff you want to bring along, minus development and mangement 
costs, minus extra operating costs.  TANSTAAFL.



I'm sure that if you reread this you'll see that your argument is falacious.


Pat, not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that's _made_ to 
perform this task, it also ignores the point.  There is a desire to have 
astronauts available so that if the door fails to open, something can be done
about it.  Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door,
you haven't solved the problem.

Tunisia one year later but Egypt may face direct colonization very soon to
prevent an Islamic government which might take over after Egypt attacks 
SUdan and is envolved in atrocities there as it fails to achieve
victory.  Meanwhile Saudia faces a civil war and goes to war 
with Yemen/Sudan over it,  The new North African 
Alliance (Algeria/Tun/Libya) goes to war with Morocco who attacks it.
U.S/France involved everywhere but cannot concentrate on one place, 
especially that Syria/Jordan/Iraq have to be kept under control.

"Hi.

I'm not sure what the other guy (can't track down his post for his name)
was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable.
They are.  There's a space between each link where the ""teeth"" of the 
locking head notch in.  Thus, each link is a possible locking point.

Also, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around
liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks ""LOOK"" a lot
more effective than kryptonite cable locks (IMHO) and I think the initial
appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at-
cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally 
functional.

Finally, I notice that when I ride with my leathers, harness boots, and
the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (BTW, I've crashed in the rain
dressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae), cagers give
me a much wider berth, don't hassle me, and tend to avoid any potentially
inflammatory action at stoplights.

I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80's Honda dinosaur.

That's a fallacy, and it is not the first time it is pointed out.
For one, you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. Unlike
a football. Further, you conveniently ignore here that there are
many who would not agree on tghe morality of something. The analogy
does not hold.
 
One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football,
while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees
with a set of morals YOU have to give.
 
Further, the above is evidence, not proof. Proof would evolve out of testing
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories.

This is, shall we say, an overly-broad statement.  In particular, are you

the eastern US rather than the whole continent.)  Given that those were
*radically* different cultures, which one are you referring to?


Note that the pre-Columbian native Americans, east of the Mississippi,
did all of these things.  (Well, maybe not ""on Sunday"", but they did
have organized religions, not to mention cities and governments.)  If

"Another article that fell between the cracks:

 As evidence for the Resurrection, it is often claimed that the Disciples
were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce
their claim that Jesus had come back from the dead.
 Now, I skimmed Acts and such, and I found a reference to this happening
to Stephen, but no others. Where does this apparently very widely held
belief come from? Is there any evidence outside the Bible? Is there any
evidence *in* the Bible? I sure haven't found any...

Briefly, no.  There is widespread folklore, but no good documentary
evidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles.
Further, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is ""No
Martyrs for a Lie"": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather
than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds the
quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered
the chance of life by recanting.  Since we don't even know how or
where they died, we certainly don't have this information.  (By the
way, even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could
have saved himself by recanting).  The willingness of true believers
to die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is
well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.  [See
1Kings18:20-40 for a Biblical account of the martyrdom of 450 priests
of Baal].

I looked back at this, and asked some questions of various people and
got the following information which I had claimed and you pooh-poohed.
The US has not sold Iraq any arms.  Their navy is entirely made of
F-USSR vessels.  Their airforce (not including stuff captured from Kuwait
which I am not as sure about), doesn't include any US equipment.  Their
missiles are all non-US.  Their tanks are almost all soviet, with about
100 French tanks (older ones). The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal
is a few M113s.  Those were not sold to Iraq.  Iraq captured them from
other countries (like Kuwait).  Information is hard to prove.  You are
claiming that the US sold information?  Prove it. 

Now, how did the US build up Iraq again?  I just gave some fairly
conclusive evidence that the US didn't sell arms to Iraq.  Information
is hard to prove, almost certainly if the US did sell information, then that
fact is classified, and you can't prove it.  If you can provide some
useful evidence that the US sold arms or valuable intelligence to Iraq,

"May 13, 1993  _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_
 
MOSCOW (UPI) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia's 7th army stationed in
Armenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for
allegedly ""carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers."" 

A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey
said ""the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal,"" the 
Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported. 

But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed
over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment. 

""This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have
committed crimes,"" the statement reads. 

The five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison
sentence, were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar
district of Azerbaijan, between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. 

The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a
company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan, after which
they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to 
carry out diversions against Azeri troops. 

However, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the
Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in
the battle zone round Karabakh. 

Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for
five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has
left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes. 

Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed
in these Caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the 
Soviet Union, are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war. 

The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the
Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the
six men, and to hand them over to the Russian authorities. 

It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request 
to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey. Itar-tass said that the soldiers' defense
attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency.

[TC] Do you, as I do, agree that this (sort) of ""peace process"" is needed?
[TC] What about the particular points mentioned in the article? Is what
[TC] Israel is (supposedly) going to propose ""good""? Does it go too far?
[TC] Not far enough?

[TC] If you don't agree that a ""peace process"" is needed, what is?

I personally think that a peace process is needed, since only through
negotiations will the future generations be able to live in stability.
Unfortunately not all think like this, we have cases like:
	Anas Omran, Hamza Saleh, Jle, Mohammed Reza, Mehmed Abu-Abed, 
Anwar Mohammed and others who think that JIHAD is the only solution. 

I wish that people (including myself) would have more objective views like Tim,
Basil and Shai for example and put the rhetoric aside and start discussing
""substance"".

My view is that Israel has made more gestures towards its Arab foes than the
opposite. What have the Sysrians given to us or proposed? What have the
Palestinians proposed? If the Palestinians would just revoke or rewrite their 
charter, or just condemn acts of Palestinian violence that would be a good
start.
The Palestinians have all to gain from these negotiations. Its seems though
that they are not strong enough to make decisions on their own and are
plagued by internal strife, that is why we are not getting anywhere.
Fundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories, then it will be
too late to discuss issues with the Palestinians since they will only
vow for the destruction of Israel.
Arabs  must take example on Egypt. Egypt came to the bargaining table,
got what it wanted from Israel and there is now peace and cooperation
between the two countries. 
The tougher you play ball with Israel the tougher Israel gets.

We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational
constant that day:  the closer I got to those exposed fangs (still dripping,
no doubt, with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine
psychology) the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become.  Also, 
recall that the distribution of the ~150lb is one five pound jaw+teeth 
operated by two 70lb muscles driven by a .005 ounce brain possessing an
instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger.
The other ~5 lb is, of course, dog poop, but that varies all over the place 
as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended 
lawns of the dog's owner's neighbors (whilst continuously replenishing its
inexhaustible supply, no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me).


My very thought at the time, but as I looked down at these once formidable 
instruments of mayhem, I realized they had become weak and atrophied by too
many sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically-correct CRT keyboard.
There was only one option left: I reached down to the toolbox near my
car and grasped my Craftsman 150 ft-lb torque wrench, surely the bludgeon
of dire necessity if ever there was one.  To my amazement and
confusion, the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass, then leapt
to its feet and vanished down the street, still quivering and occasionally 
looking back at me.  

""Seven at One Blow!"" I exclaimed, flexing my new-found biceps and brandishing
my Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked the now-secure environs
of my domicile.  It was only later that I found out what the dog apparently
knew all along: the wrench was defective, would no longer measure torque
accurately, and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it.  What I had interpreted
as fear and subservience were in fact unmitigated hilarity and contempt.

Well, it's not that simple -- you're in Earth's magnetic field, and you
don't generate electricity -- but it can be done.


The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first
question is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say ""propel"" rather than
""power"", the answer is ""sort of"".)  Yes, you can use interaction with the
Earth's magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential
applications for this.

However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn't
coming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy
of your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where
this is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion
is useful only in special situations, however.

What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays,
and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy
*into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.

If you want more information, trying looking up ""electrodynamic propulsion"",
""tether applications"", and ""magsails"".

#You, Frank O'Dwyer, are living in a dream world. I wonder if there is any
#base of discussion left after such a statement. As a matter of fact, I think
#you are ignorant of human nature. Even when one starts with something one does
#not believe, one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says.
# 
#To give you the benefit of the doubt, prove your statement.

The onus of proof is on you, sunshine.  What makes you think that
theist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say
one thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its
opposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but it's there
for anyone to see.  It's almost an epidemic in this country.

Just for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru' the eye
of a needle, why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?  Why
are there churches to the square inch in my country?

#>#>of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?

#>#That's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to

#>#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,
#>#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.

#>No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common

#>what you say before, because you're trying to sneak in ""innate features
#>of [all] theism"".  The word you're groping for is ""some"".
#>
# 
#Bogus again. Not all theism as is is fanatic. However, the rest already
#gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and
#theism. And further, the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them
#to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the
#theology.

Truth by blatant assertion.  
# 
# 
#>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.
#>
#>No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,
#>since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed
#>to the case you are trying to make?
#>
# 
#Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people
#causing the correlation. And the whole discussion started that way by the
#statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism, which you
#challenged.

Indeed I did.  As I recall, I asked for evidence.  What is the correlation
of which you speak?  
# 
# 
#>#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
#>#men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.
#>
#>I said it reads like a warm up to that.  That's because it's an irrational

#>side of church walls.
#>
# 
#Blah blah blah. I am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights
#protects me better from fanatics than the other way round.

Of course, other people are always fanatics, never oneself.  Your
wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me.
# 
#It is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between
#that argument and the rise of fanatism. So far, it is just another of your
#assertions.

So?  You can do it.

Truth by blatant assertion.  I've seen as many bogus proofs of the 
non-existence of gods as I have of their existence.

#Rational systems, by the way, does not mean that every data has to come from

I'd like to see this alleged evidence.

#They don't use theism when doing science. Or it wouldn't be science. Please

# 
#The example with your neighbours is a fallacy. That *your* neighbours don't
#says little about others. And there were times when exactly that happened.

Nope, it's not a fallacy.   It just doesn't go to the correlation you
wish to see.
# 
#And tell me, when it is not irrelevant, why are such statements about
#Amalekites and Idolaters in the Holy Books? Please note that one could
#edit them out when they are not relevant anymore. Because gods don't err?
#What does that say about that message?

Excuse me - THE Holy Books?
# 
#And how come we had theists saying genocides ordered by god are ok. A god
#is the easiest way to excuse anything, and therefore highly attracting to
#fanatics. Not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatics can

A god is neither the easiest way to excuse anything, nor the only way.

 pages 202-203:

  <<In 1865, immediately after enactment of the new Organic Statute for the
  Jewish community, and just as Jewish capital from Europe was beginning
  to have an effect in Istanbul, local Armenians and Greeks started a pogrom
  against Jews immediately across the sea of Marmara at Haydarpasa, terminus
  of the Anatolia railroad, with three hundred Jews massacred and many more
  beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the Sultan sent
  his personal guard across the bay to protect the Jews [39].

  In later years, ritual murder attacks against Jews, carried out mostly
  by native Greeks, Armenians, and, in Arab provinces, by Maronites and
  other Arab Christians, often with the assistance of the local European
  consuls, took place throughout the empire. There were literally thousands
  of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far
  west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and
  the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south
  as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These
  invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians
  by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian
  financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of
  the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian
  massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting
  in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops
  and homes.

  Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of
  Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt
  and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases
  with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose
  Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the
  rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of
  instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread
  their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where
  their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes
  such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled
  them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with
  little question or opposition.

  On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British
  High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David
  and Nissim Ades, in Cairo:

    ''Sir,

      I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which
      has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which
      contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews,
      especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant.
      Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism,
      Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison
      the people's minds with exaggeration and painted words? In an article,
      he asserted that the Jews use Christian blood for Passover, of course
      this has caused a deal of excitement.'' [40]

  Whenever Greek and other Orthodox religious authorities or prominent
  Greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence
  or reduce tension, they invariably indicated their cooperation and then
  failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated
  or led them. [41]

How about the discussion of the STS Tether experiment.  Ran forward,
it would suck energy from the Earth's magnetic field, while trivially
slowing the Shuttle.  It could also have run backward -- if they ran 
electricity through the tether the other way, it would have trivially
propelled the Shuttle faster.

someone like Craig Anderton or Don Lancaster.  Ten years ago he wrote about
an invention of his.  He could take a light-detector, run current through
it at about a hundred times its rating, and it would glow.  He got legal

Mathew, I agree.  This, it seems, is the crux of your whole position,
isn't it?  That the US shouldn't have supported Hussein and sold him arms
to fight Iran?  I agree.  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those
who did or do.  But we *did* sell arms to Hussein, and it's a done deal.
Now he invades Kuwait.  So do we just sit back and say, ""Well, we sold
him all those arms, I suppose he just wants to use them now.  Too bad
for Kuwait.""  No, unfortunately, sitting back and ""letting things be""
is not the way to correct a former mistake.  Destroying Hussein's
military potential as we did was the right move.  But I agree with
your statement, Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to
sell arms to Hussein.  So it's really not the Gulf War you abhor
so much, it was the U.S.'s and the West's shortsightedness in selling
arms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable, right?

If so, then I agree.

The annihilation of Islam (""Turks"") is an older Serbian agenda.   But
I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,
in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen
themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly
relations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is 
anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong.

To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply
they are not separate peoples.  The events of the past two years
clearly show Muslim determination to remain separate: in their alliance
with Croats, they maintained this separation.  Croats would have
accepted a much closer relationship, I think.  This century plus
of building bridges between these two friendly peoples is now at
risk, because of the inexorable logic of war.  

Since Bosnian Serbs (32% of population) have 10 times more heavy
weapons than Bosnian Muslims (44%) and Croats (17%) combined, they
have squeezed Muslims and Croats into only 30% of the territory.
Muslims lost more territory than Croats (who built defenses early on).

Under these conditions, any alliance is bound to fall apart since
it is easier to recover lost land from Croats than from Serbs.
The only thing keeping this in check was the hope of reversal of
fortunes through foreign military intervention and lifting of the
arms embargo.  Since Warren Christopher had no luck persuading
the Europeans to go along with this, this hope was dashed.  Having
no prospect of outside help, the former allies turned on each other,
like two starved animals in a tight cage.

This inexorable logic, of course, got plenty of help from Serbian
intelligence operatives, who were doing everything to build
mistrust between Croats and Muslims for over a year.  A timely
intervention to stop Serbian aggression would have prevented this.

Sadly, nothing was done to create a balance of power on the
ground.  As long as the Serbs enjoy 10:1 advantage, they can 
break any alliance, even among friends.  This is tragic, but
hardly new: ""divide et impera"" was used by ancient Romans
with success.  In my view, Bosnian Muslims and Croats managed
to resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until May 9, 1993,
when the hope of reversal of fortunes was lost.  

I have a question for the distinguished diplomats: do they
believe Balkan peoples are experimental cannon fodder?  I'd like to know
what did they expect when they decided to enforce the arms embargo which
solidified Serbian 10:1 advantage in heavy weapons; how did they expect
to prevent fragmentation of the Muslim and Croat defense forces;  and how
on Earth do they hope to restore peace without justice?

The implications of this immoral approach I cannot begin to predict,
but I am filled with foreboding...",4

"Ken:

Your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big
Boys if you're tackling Henry.  Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in
on the subject of staggering operational costs, too.  Good luck, son.


Ahem.  The Russians are in the Free World now, or at least it would be
Politically Correct to contend so.


It will be tough to make DC-X succeed, and to turn it into an
operational orbital vehicle.  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of
the promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it's
the *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come,
to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.  

There is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling
away, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any
zeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame for
this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual
billions of the, er, Free World's available space cash.  As you will
no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:

DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping
development costs low and flying incremental ""X-plane"" hardware.
It's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a
complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would
have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s
America, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or
building the DC-Y.

I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any
expansion of astronautics.  I don't see a realistic  prospect for
beating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If
the DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and
the Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a
prospect too depressing to bear.

(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different
direction.  It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital
launch for under ten megabucks.  It's creating its own market for
small payloads.)

I read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There are
plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some
of them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today's
world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an
assembly line.

[...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...]

Strawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please. 
The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which
includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle
operations, as well as the ""bird in the hand"" argument your common
sense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the
Shuttle, not instead of it.

Also, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful
for a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.


If a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M,
rather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford
more payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites
instead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Little
outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of
begging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.  You should be able
to convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes a
big difference in costs.  Do you have some reason to think not?",3

the Armenians of Karabakh are being forced by Azerbaijan to either become 
Azeris or leave, and it also will not succeed, as has been demonstrated. 

Karabakh, irrespective of its geographic position situated technically within
the Stalin-prepared borders of Azerbaijan, has been long oppressed and 
eventually was invaded in 1991 by Azeri OMON and Soviet forces, resulting in 
the northern third of this Armenian area being depopulated of Armenians. The 
Armenians have been fighting back ever since. 

Clearly, you feel it rather ridiculous for Armenians, of let's say Glendale, 
California, to engage in an independence movement for a free and independent
Glendale. Similarly, the Azerbaijanis are engaging in a losing attempt at
claiming sovereignty over the land and people of Karabakh, who have lived
continuously in Karabakh a thousand years before the first Central Asian 
invaders ever stepped foot in the Caucasus.

Of the ~93% (I have heard figures closer to 80%, but I won't quibble your

enemy troops.  A B-52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie, and we used them

where civilians were close to the target.  We dropped by tonnage very
little bombs in populated regions, explaining the figures.  


This figure, is far below all the other figures I have seen.  If it
is indeed accurate, then how do you explain the discrepancy between
that figure, and other figures from international organizations?
Most figures I have seen place the hit ratio close to 70%, which is 
still far higher than your 35%.  Or does your figure say a bomb
missed if the plane took off with it, and the bomb never hit the target,
regardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped?  Such methods
are used all the time to lie with statistics.

INTRODUCTION

     From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for
untold thousands of years. Ancient astronomers observed points of
light that appeared to move among the stars. They called these
objects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman
deities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;
Mercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and
beauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The
stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors
or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.

     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.
Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were
discovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were
calculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device
called the telescope at the heavens and made startling
discoveries.

     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of
solar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World
War II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth's gravity
and travel to the Moon and to other planets.

     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then
human-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated
machines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the
Sun's environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys
while flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and
understanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight
and other ""senses"" of our automated spacecraft, color and
complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared
to Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.
And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.

     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights
through the solar system as some of the most remarkable
achievements of the 20th century.
     

AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT

     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's)
automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many
shapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and
specific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.

     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments
selected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems
for electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well
as for processing data and communicating with Earth.

     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft
instruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays
of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its
solar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for
backup and supplemental power.

     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed
millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a
planet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments
pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help
prevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to
control spacecraft.

     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a
constant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth's early seafarers
used the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to
maintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto
fixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a
spacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target body
and the craft's communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The
thrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed
of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at
the planned distance and on the proper trajectory.

     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to
study the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the
inner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These
three worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets
because they share a solid-rock composition.

     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA
employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the
Mariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later
missions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted
the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.

     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power
source. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had
two wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were
equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal
bodies.

     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus
spacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the
Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147
pounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the
program. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had
originally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The
Mariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components
left over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.

     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.
Interest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite
different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.

     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers
-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar
system. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took
anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.
Barring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first
human artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun's
light becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers
do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity
generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.

     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit
our neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin
Viking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather
stations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --
descendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers
from Earth and then studied martian features from above.

     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.
The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument
that allowed it to ""see"" through the planet's dense cloud cover
to study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried
four probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and
the main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --
radioed information about the planet's atmosphere during their
descent toward the surface.

     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including
Magellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet
Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being
developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed
examinations that will increase our understanding of our
neighborhood and our own planet.
     

The Sun

     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start
with the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing
approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;
all of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up
to only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the
material left over from the Sun's formation. One hundred and nine
Earths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk, and its
interior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.

     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of
fusion. The temperature at the Sun's core is 15 million degrees
Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there
is 340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level. The Sun's
surface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees
Fahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.
At the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing
energy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams
of charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.

     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years
and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or
so. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium
into heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing
so large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a
""red giant,"" it will suddenly collapse into a ""white dwarf"" --
the final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion
years to cool off completely.

     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun's environment, but
none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately
two-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,
the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft
have all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,
launched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and
the European Space Agency. After using Jupiter's gravity to
change its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun's polar
regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of
studies using nine onboard scientific instruments.

     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If
it were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly
never have developed on Earth.
     

Mercury

     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the
primary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on
November 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a
journey of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,
the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the
solar system's innermost planet on March 29, 1974.

     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the
best telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct
object lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the
Sun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is
visible on Earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it
is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar
telescopes gave any hint of Mercury's surface conditions prior to
the voyage of Mariner 10.

     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an
ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own
Moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the
planet. These apparently were created when Mercury's interior
cooled and shrank, buckling the planet's crust. The cliffs are as
high as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310
miles).

     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak
magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the
density of Earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon
and helium. When the planet's orbit takes it closest to the Sun,
surface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees
Fahrenheit) on Mercury's sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius
(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface
temperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --
is the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury
literally bakes and freezes at the same time.

     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a
slow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid
revolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury
solar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time
it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the
Sun! 

     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like
that of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich
core making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would
make Mercury's core larger, proportionally, than the Moon's core
or those of any of the planets.

     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two
additional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --
before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted
and the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same
local Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was
illuminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the
planet's surface.
     

Venus

     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary
neighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2
spacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more
than a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the
mysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,
plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus' surface,
romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to
rest.

     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839
kilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first
spacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured
Venus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much
closer to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544
miles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5's
instruments measured the planet's magnetic field, ionosphere,
radiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner
10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth
showing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.

     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were
launched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4
of the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first
spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.

     Five days later, the five separate components making up the
second spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the
Venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The
four small, independent probes and the main body radioed
atmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the
surface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the
probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to
transmit data for another hour.

     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and
density more closely than any other known planet. However,
spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For
example, Venus' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)
compared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other
planets.

     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus' atmosphere (95 times as
dense as Earth's) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of
Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus' atmosphere acts like a
greenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but
trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into
space. As a result, the planet's average surface temperature is
482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt
lead.

     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the
first means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover and
determining surface features over almost the entire planet.
NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in
orbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses
radar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images
of the surface.

     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic
features, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface
show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows
lying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar
Terra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At
one end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size
of Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain's flank is a
100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep
impact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are
named for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are
the exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million
years because there is no water and very little wind erosion.

     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the
result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics
on Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to
weaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing
the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like
the San Andreas Fault in California.

     Venus' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,
high-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At
speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,
the clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The
circulation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus'
slow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth's winds blow in
both directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six
alternating bands. Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplified
laboratory for the study of our weather.
     

Earth

     As viewed from space, our world's distinguishing
characteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses
and white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting
of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other
constituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor
life, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million
kilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the
Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter
just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.

     Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give
rise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the
atmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation
coming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protects
us from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can
strike the surface. Active geological processes have left no
evidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon
after it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the
other newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in
the early days of the solar system.

     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our
home planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was
launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and
discovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen
radiation belts, surrounding Earth.

     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our
planet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by
the solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously
ejected from the Sun. We've learned that the magnetic field does
not fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now
know that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and
uneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and
contracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the
upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.

     Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise
to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged
particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic
field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's
magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are
known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.

     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in
space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These
watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous
global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and
contributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weather
systems.

     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey
Earth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet's
health. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided
tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our
planet in dangerous ways.
     

The Moon

     The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite. The first
human footsteps on an alien world were made by American
astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless
companion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo
expeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and
Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.

     NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials
and data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the
lunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection
of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)
and consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.

     From this material and other studies, scientists have
constructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.
Rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3
billion years old. The first few million years of the Moon's
existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.
As a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into
different kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids
and smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode
Island or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created
basins hundreds of kilometers across.

     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four
billion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,
overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken
rock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to
melt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million
years -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose
from inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the
surface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas
that Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,
called maria, meaning seas.

     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant
volcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.
Since then, the lunar surface has been altered only by
micrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,
by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and
astronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion
years ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the
one today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the
Apollo crews will remain sharp and clear.

     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories
attempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate
body; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was
captured by our planet's gravity, or it was the result of a
collision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.
The last theory has some good support but is far from certain.
     

Mars

     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar
system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.
Astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what
appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These
observations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led
to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a
system of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson
Welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction
classic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed
in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.

     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to
do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet's
surface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might
support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months
and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.

     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.
Four Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one
placed into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively
before the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.

     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,
1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the
surface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the
planet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring
channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.
Mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of
1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a
diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry
atmosphere of carbon dioxide.

     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a
mission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The
spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to
find Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made
surface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the
storm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329
pictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,
including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across
the surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.

     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft
-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from
Kennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several
questions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?
Nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was
hoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at
least find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.

     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully
touch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,
while the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos
sent back from the Chryse Planitia (""Plains of Gold"") showed a
bleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the
lander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked
by rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives
the sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia
Planitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape
than the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible
dunes.

     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking
Lander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil
were tested in three different experiments designed to detect
biological processes. While some of the test results seemed to
indicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this
activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soil
chemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the
Viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist
there.

     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind
velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and
pressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest
temperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7
degrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.

     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees
Fahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2
site during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at
the two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but
because the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking
Lander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably
water-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.

     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily
carbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small
percentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much
water as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,
forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around
the slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning
fog can form in valleys.

     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian
atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical
features closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and
islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.

     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and
irregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is
possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too
close to Mars and were captured by its gravity.

     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins
their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The
first to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on
July 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.
Viking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut
down because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on
August 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was
used up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.

     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology
experiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except
Earth. NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in
September 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian
environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. 
     

Asteroids

     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic
objects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be
considered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as
asteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a
band or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have
orbits that cross Earth's path, and there is evidence that Earth
has been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,
best preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near
Winslow, Arizona.

     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the
solar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a
planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More
likely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a
planet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was
gathered into a single object, the object would be only about
1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the
diameter of our Moon. 

     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It
is estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be
photographed through Earth-based telescopes.

     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from
examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of
Earth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are
called meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at
high velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to
incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the
meteoroid does not burn up completely, what's left strikes
Earth's surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places
to look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.

     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of
silicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and
nickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony
meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much
like terrestrial rocks.

     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar
system, scientists are interested in their composition.
Spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found
that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are
separated by very large distances.

     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids
for closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in
October 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to
Jupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini
missions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for
launch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini
missions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space
Agency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as
well as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.
One day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw
materials.
     

Jupiter

     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of
our solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four
spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these
colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter
was the first port of call.

     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in
March 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid
belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In
December 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,
flying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet's
banded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1
and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned
spectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites
during flybys in 1979.

     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of
liquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere
composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice
crystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps
phosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that
characterize Jupiter's atmosphere.

     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases
react to form organic molecules in the regions between the
planet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying
below. Because of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics, however, these
organic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.

     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through
telescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter's
atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a
high-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction
opposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is
surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and
are sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a
million years old.

     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter's upper
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth's
northern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned
the first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.

     Largest of the solar system's planets, Jupiter rotates at a
dizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The
massive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey
around the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a
miniature solar system.

     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under
way. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once
past Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two
asteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into
Jupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo
Orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close
to Jupiter's large moons, exploring in detail what the two
Pioneers and two Voyagers revealed.
     

Galilean Satellites

     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and
spotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first
time, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of
their discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the
Galilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily
traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs
returned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these
planet-sized satellites.

     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission
was the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.
Volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world
other than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine
active volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending
as far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon's surface.

     Io's pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow
hues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to
the surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this
satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the
gravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three
Galilean moons.

     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the
brightest Galilean satellite. The moon's surface displays a
complex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been
fractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa
has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --
apparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered
by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the
cold of space. Europa's core is made of rock that sank to its
center.

     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and
Callisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest
satellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury
and Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or
ice and the rest rock. Ganymede's surface has areas of different
brightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of
the moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on the
surface.

     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the
lowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large
amounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the
most heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity
during its history has erased old craters except more impacts.

     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be
performed by the Galileo Orbiter.
     

Saturn

     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its
exquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is
composed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors
and wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn's atmosphere
has a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted
by high-altitude haze. Given Saturn's somewhat placid-looking
appearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity
equatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100
miles) per hour.

     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11
sped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,
returning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in
November 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that
revealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn's ring
system and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in
August 1981.

     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles
orbiting individually around Saturn's equator at progressive
distances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves
passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely
in size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are
bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.

     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body
ventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been
torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its
interior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin
with and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn's gravity. A
third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions
with larger objects orbiting the planet.

     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each
other, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by
the gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These
complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets
that make up the major rings.

     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM
car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager
spacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are
believed to be coming from Saturn's ring system rather than its
atmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at
Jupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras near
Saturn's poles.

     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several
satellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons
shepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn's rings and the gaps
in the rings. Saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from
images taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. 

     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based
atmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth's in
composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and
Venus. Titan's surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290
degrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands
rising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.
Unfortunately, Voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon's
dense clouds.

     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be
converting Titan's methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in
combination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter
compound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may
be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth
between three and four billion years ago. However, Titan's
atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit
progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.

     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini
mission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will
also deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into
Titan's atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the
probe as well as radar to peer through Titan's clouds and will
spend years examining the Saturnian system.
     

Uranus

     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting
Saturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the
Uranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about
Uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from
ground observations since the planet's discovery over two
centuries ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.

     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the
solar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of
Pluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and
south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing
around the solar system. During Voyager 2's flyby, the south pole
faced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an
Earth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the
solar system.

     Voyager 2 found that Uranus' magnetic field does not follow
the usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,
the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet's
center, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one
magnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of
Djakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.

     Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12
percent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water
vapor. The planet's blue color occurs because methane in its
atmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580
kilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud
tops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).

     Uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of
photochemical ""smog"" believed to be a combination of acetylene,
ethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the
planet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into
space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as ""electroglow.""

     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus'
cloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and
dissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.
Beneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.

     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105
miles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --
Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from
520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing
a geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock
spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past
activity, including faulting and ice flows.

     The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda. Its surface
features high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and
winding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,
after the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with
another body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which
contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments
from large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda
apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in
its interior exposed on its surface.

     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged
11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which are composed of bright
particles, Uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark,
boulder-sized chunks.
     

Neptune

     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system
with an investigation of Neptune and the planet's moons. On
August 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers
(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.
During the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet's
atmosphere was more active than Uranus'. 

     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the
size of Earth, in Neptune's atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter's
Great Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves
westward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager
2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed
the ""Scooter,"" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main
hydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any
planet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per
hour.

     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen
and helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet's core
contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the
other gas giants. Neptune's distinctive blue appearance, like
Uranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.

     Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's
spin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is
similar to Uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of
the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,
where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the
electrical properties of a metal. Earth's magnetic field, on the
other hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only
slightly tilted and offset relative to its center.

     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune's rings.
Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of
material in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how
Neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from
spreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected
these arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.
A number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies
were not spotted.

     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in
1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new
moons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since
Proteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet's
glare for observers on Earth.

      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six
days. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly
towards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in
astronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian
gravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to
accompany the planet's modest current rings.

     Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of
Io and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at
Saturn and Uranus. Triton's mantle is probably composed of
water-ice, but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and
methane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of
terrain: the so-called ""cantaloupe"" terrain and a receding ice
cap. 

     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the
fallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas
and dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers
(1 to 5 miles). Triton's thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as
thick as Earth's, has winds that carry the dark particles and
deposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet
found in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees
Fahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other
object spacecraft have so far visited.
     

Pluto

     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the
eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside
Neptune's orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will
remain until March 1999. Pluto's orbit is also highly inclined --
tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.

     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a
celestial snowball. The planet's diameter is calculated to be
approximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the
size of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto's
surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin
atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet
moves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto's spin
axis is tipped by 122 degrees. 

     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in
1978. Charon's surface composition is different from Pluto's: the
moon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane
ice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both
bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto's
and Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolution
are all 6.4 Earth days. 

     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is
currently exploring the possibility of such a mission.
     

Comets

     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a
visit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and
metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets
are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only
far from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a
loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching
perhaps halfway to the nearest star.

     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are
gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close
to the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer
planets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually
warm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner
planets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself
is irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally
of water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar
to those composing the moons of the giant planets.

     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma
or cloud-like ""head"" that can measure tens of thousands of
kilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the
Sun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes
on this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving
rise to the comet's ""tails."" Gases and ions are blown directly
back from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.
As the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are
left behind in a curved arc.

     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in
effect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.
The tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in
length, but the total amount of material contained in this
dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --
from the Latin cometa, meaning ""long-haired"" -- are essentially
dramatic light shows.

     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but
others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close
encounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter
visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return
to the inner solar system.

     Halley's Comet is the most famous example of a relatively
short period comet, returning on an average of once every 76
years and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus' orbit.
Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular
visitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,
because he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return,
based on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name
became part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet
returned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to
see it.

     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes
comparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent
appearance, Halley's Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million
kilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was
visible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern
hemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so
bright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.
Historically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens
and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.

     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will
become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and
remain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF
will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing
sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and
form a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at
high speed; the first was NASA's International Cometary Explorer
in 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet
and the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by
Halley's Comet in 1986.
     

Conclusion

     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of
space through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had
only one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,
spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our
neighbors in space. 

     We have learned more about our solar system and its members
than anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated
spacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets
beyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large
as small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar
environment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of
bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for
generations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange
and beautiful places and objects.

     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar
system has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and
meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called
comparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,
moons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and
similarities, we are learning more about the origin and history
of these bodies and the solar system as a whole.

     We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weather
systems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by
investigating the Sun's activity and its influence throughout the
solar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and
processes on Earth.

     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated
spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission
is mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach
the Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future
missions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid
belt.

     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once
again set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not
been back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being
formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the
human exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian
outposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a
lunar base or a martian colony!",3

Come again? The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing 
glory in their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood 
and independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged 
in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed 
genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia 
and x-Soviet Armenia before and during World War I and fully 
participated in the extermination of the European Jewry 
during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing, 
rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the 
Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians 
engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal 
they tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million 
Turks and Kurds before and during World War I.

And the justice is long overdue.

So far, you have presented your opinions as opposed to mine. I would
hardly take them as facts.



I could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue (Spanish), that
are comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary. Even more, I
could show you a lot of meanings that words in Spanish have different
from those in the dictionary.


And guess why. Isn't it curious that we do not know how many people define 
in how many different ways the term Jew, which is the basis of the movement 
itself?
So, the evidence shows that up to now, Jew, when considered in terms of Israel,
the Law of Return and Jewish Nationality is defined in terms of religion and
not of cultural identity, even if 80% of those defined as Jews in Isreal
are not religious.



That IS a problem. I am saying that I do not support Zionism as it is
now. I believe that among the people in the Soviet Communist Party some
might even had been inspired by noble ideals. Does that change the
final results of what happened in the USSR?
In the same way, even if the Zionist movement is not homogeneous, it
does not matter. What matters is the result.


I never said it directly nor indirectly. I am not talking about individuals
who defined themselves as zionists here. I am sure most of them are good,
honest and caring people. I am talking about the results of the Zionist
Movement. I am talking about a Movement whose actions resulted in a
Law of Return with a religious definition of Jew, a country that defines
nationality based on religion. I am talking about something I consider
a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief. 
After all, if Arabs in Israel cannot serve in the Army is becasue they 
were not born in the ""right"" religion.


I had never heard the definition: Only those who are religious are defined as Jews.
I had always seen the definition: A person is a Jew is his/her mother is/was
a Jew, and if such person does not convert, although I had seen people
argue about the last part.


So, there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in Israel?
Or what do you mean by ""Actually, it doesn't""?


So, it follows a religious definition and not a cultural one. That is what
I call a form of racism.


You do not need to assume the representation of ""everybody else"" to 
make your points. You should assume that you are just talking for yourself.
About the other stuff, I still believe that the example was a valid one.
It would be a hypocrisy to say that one supports nationalism for all and
then support Zionism and then disregard the Palestinian's right.


It was an example. You are trying to justify something nobody has 
talked about.



Reference.


yes, but not all of them. A language is something that evolves all the time.


Not really. I posted in another post the definition of Zionism. And, in
this post you have showed for me what I was telling you from the 
begining. Zionism is a form of racism, even if most zionists are not
racist in their individual and private lifes. A movement that ask
for a State and National rights for a people, and then in practice,
that people are defined according to religion is, for me, racist-like.


You did it. Next time be more careful.

The ""artist renderings"" that I've seen of the HST reboost still have
the arrays fully extended, with a cradle holding HST at a ~30 degree
angle to the Shuttle.  I think the rendering was conceived before the
array replacemnet was approved, so I'm not sure if the current reboost
will occur with the arrays deployed or not.  However, it doesn't 
appear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost.

Thanks for the input on GRO's S/A design constraints.  That would 
explain the similar design on UARS.


Heck, the MMS project used to design _missions_ with servicing in mind.
The XTE spacecraft was originally designed as an on-orbit replacement
for the instrument module on EUVE.  That way, you get two instruments
for the price of one spacecraft bus (the Explorer Platform).  A 
second on-orbit replacement was also considered, with the FUSE telescope.

YOu forget,  that during skylab,  they did  overnight mission planning
for the repair EVA's.   Also during theøÄ   
Intelsat Mission,   they did overnight  WETF simulations.
I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in  8 months.

And as for building hardware,  anything can  be built if you want it
bad enough.

YOu forget,  the  BUS 1  is already built.  all they'd ahve to do
is soup it up, even test it  on a delta mission.

Don't get into this mode of  negativism.   besides,  at the rate
missions slip,   the Discovery won't launch on this mission until
March.  that's almost a year.


Ah,  but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing mission.

YOu forget,  there is a bum FGS,  the Solar array electronics, are
getting hinky  and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission.

The time for the space walks are growing rapidly.  THis was orignally
planned out as 3 spacewalks,  now they are at 5 EVA's  with 3 reserve
walks.

If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that's $500 million
saved.  If the Weight savings,  means they  can sit on orbit  for 30 Days.
and  handle any contingency  problems,  that's quite a savings.



Of course,  there wasn't any need for the Saturn  V  after apollo too.

"ERGINEL) asked:

[EE] No, no flaming here. Just a simple question.

...with a simple answer!

[EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox
[EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is
[EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism
[EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. 

The vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian
Apostolic. There was, however, a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians 
in Cilicia, closer to the Mediterranean, in Adana, Marash, Aintab, etc.  

[EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia
[EE] did not speak any Armenian, but used Turkish in their everyday lives.

This is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in
certain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact,
Turks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all
Armenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger 
society.

[EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what
[EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian
[EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion
[EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn't even speak
[EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the
[EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian 
[EE] consciousness.

The Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless
of the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian
nationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later 
stages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to 
Islam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This 
practice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy 
of clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these
converted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems. 

[EE] Any information will be appreciated.

You answered your own question! The common thread throughout your inquiry
was the word Armenian!

Please cite specific examples where an Arab party member was rejected
while a Jewish party member was accepted.  If you examine these I am
sure you will discover that the Arab party member did not have the power
base that his Jewish counterpart had.  The party structure in Israel
has changed quite a bit insofar as knesset member elections go.  Knesset
members for most parties are now elected via primaries.  The top standing
members end up with cabinet posts.  This is purely a political power
issue.  Check the ranking of Arab labor party members, as opposed
to Jewsih members and let me know which posts are held by Jews that
ranked lower in the party than their Arab fellow electees.

Once again, if for arguments sake, all the Arab Israelis were to vote
for Labor at the next election, you can rest assured that the number of
Arab MKs and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the
power shift.


You are overlooking the fact that they wield political power
as individuals based upon a wider collective power base.


The reasoning I see at work is purely political.  As far as security
goes I think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing Jews

Okay, so you are going to blindly believe in things without reasonable
evidence?  I didn't realize you were a theist.  I am doubting a claim
presented without any evidence to support it.  If you are able to present
real evidence for it, then great.  But unsupported claims, or even claims
by such and such news agency will not be accepted.  If you want to
stick to the sheer impossible, instead of the merely difficult, then
fine.  

The statement that if such a fact is classified, then you 
can't prove it, is a simple matter of pragmatics and the law.  If you 
have access to classified information that you know to be classified,
and you reveal it, there is a good chance that you or someone else 
(the person who revealed it to you), is going to jail.

                       MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT
                             April 30, 1993
                              11:30 AM PDT

DSS-65 (Madrid 34 meter antenna) did not acquire the expected Mars Observer
Spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning (4/29)
at approximately 6:00 AM.  Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a
Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal
telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34
meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into
Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry
indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers
reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes
were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and
AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These
readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM
yesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check
failure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be
determining the precise cause over the next few days.

So nothing.  It may work for some, but not for others: it doesn't give any
insight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion- it would seem to be
dependent solely on the individual, as well as individually-created.  And since
Christians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better
than ours, I do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary, or even
particularly attractive.


Well, we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not, but at the
very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that, say, there
was a military conflict in Vietnam 25 years ago, then there is a supernatural
diety who wants us to live a certain way.  The fact that Jesus warned against
it means nothing.  *I* warn against it too.  Big deal.


This is not true.  The first two choices here (life and death) are scantily
documented, and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible, and
that is totally circular.  Perhaps it be better to use the imagination, or
one's ignorance.  Someone else will address this I'm sure, and refer you to
plenty of documentation...


How is this?  There is nothing more disgusting than Christian attempts to
manipulate/interpret the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the
coming of Christ.  Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is
autmoatically interpreted as the Cross.  What a miscarriage of philology.


Well, since we have skeptical hearts (thank goodness,) there is no way to get
into us.  Here we have the irreconcilable difference: Christians glorify
exactly what we tend to despise or snub: trust/belief/faith without knowledge. 
If I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my
enkephalins go up, then I may associate this as a sign of God (it will ""feel""
right, and I will trust without knowing).  Maybe.  Religosity does not seem to
be anything that is conclusively arrived at, but rather it seems to be more of
a sudden affliction...
I believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed, many of us were
not.  The question is, is suchg an attitude reflective of a _correct_ or
healthy morality.  IT would seem not to be.  The same thing could reflect
fanaticism, for example, and is any case an expression of simple selfishness.

Obviously not, as I am an atheist.  I don't think you'd get on with Jesus,
though; he was a long-haired lunatic peace-nik, was he not?


Right.  Unfortunately for you, it turned out that my opinions on the matter
were entirely consistent in that I condemned the bombing of Dresden too.

I think you're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing
policy, too.  You make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets
and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door.  As I
understand it, that is not the case; we aimed deliberately at civilian
targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the
German people.


Oh, come on.  With wars like the Falklands fresh in people's minds, that sort
of propaganda isn't going to fool anyone.

When it's too windy to stand.

When you're on the road in high winds, stay alert.  Even more alert
than your ""alert 'cause you're on a motorcycle and they're out to kill
you"" kind of alert.  Be aware of the terrain, and how it may funnel
wind in sudden gusts (well, not gusts to somebody standing there, but
it's gusty 'cause you ride through it).  If you are riding in a steady
crosswind, be aware of a hill that will block the wind, and adjust your
lean angle.  Be aware of passing trucks to your windward side, your
lean angle will change dramatically both as you enter and as you leave
their turbulance cone.  Reducing your profile may help, ie, lean on the
gas tank and kiss the triple clamp.  Keep a nimble hand on the
steering, be ready to countersteer into and out of sudden wind bursts.
Keep a larger than usual buffer zone, both ahead and behind, and to the
side, you can easily be blown half a lane over before you can react by
countersteering.  Keep a close eye on traffic in your mirror, if
someone is coming up wanting to pass, get out of their way early.  Stop
often for short brakes, extensive riding in high winds is both mentally
and physically fatiguing.

Subject: When you're not using it, turn it off!

Research has shown that the majority of the time that the United
States' 30 to 35 million personal computers are on, they are not
actively being used.  In addition, 30 to 40 percent are left running
at night and on weekends.

Computer equipment is now the fastest growing private-sector use
of electricity.  Computers alone are believed to account for five
percent of commercial electricity consumption, and may account for
ten percent by the year 2000.

If you are one of those who leave them on after you're done, it
would be a big environmental benefit if you would just TURN IT OFF
when you're not using it.  It only takes a second or two to do.

Also, the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed
by the computer itself, but by the monitor.  If you can't turn the
computer off, then please just TURN OFF THE MONITOR.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance
with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy-
efficient PCs that ""power down"" automatically when not being used
and thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation.  These
new computers will save enough electricity to power both Vermont and
New Hampshire and save up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual
electricity bills.  Look for the special EPA ""Energy Star"" logo when
you buy computers.  They should be available in one to two years.

According to the EPA studies, the energy saved will prevent CO2
emissions of 20 million tons annually, the equivalent of five million
automobiles.  Also, 140,000 tons of SO2 and 75,000 tons of nitrogen
oxide emissions will be saved; these are the major pollutants
responsible for acid rain.

Please do your part ... be responsible.  If you're not using it,
then just TURN IT OFF.

    Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your

Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more
sounds soon? If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't
be using SndPlay. Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds
to play sounds on it. It works great. You can add CallBacks to
the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting
empty. Before it gets empty.

7.1,

Callbacks are very reliable, I found them 100% reliable, even
under System 4.1. I was doing continuous background sound with
interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V
documentation.

You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of
your channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if
you have problems with sounds working when you play one per
channel and then close the channel (with the related
slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't
work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a
channel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be
because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with
a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to
the channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds
have this command at the start of them. You need to resedit
the sound and remove that command, then when you create your
channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the
channel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you
want. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you
are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.

Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the
sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses
it. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you
can too.

One little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the
Sound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not
sure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your
sounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the
Sound Manager.",1

Parts of Sen. Biden's statement were quoted by the Washington Post today:

   Let me put it plainly, Mr. Secretary.  You are required to speak
   diplomatically; I am not.  I cannot even begin to express to you
   my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to 
   participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian victory.
   ...
   What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference,
   timidity, self-delusion and hypocrisy.
   ...
   After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia, they are asking us
   to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the
   right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe
   havens' for the Bosnians...
   Let's not mince words.  European policy is based on cultural and
   religious indifference, if not bigotry.  And I think it's fair to say
   that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims
   were doing what the Serbs have done, if this was Muslim aggression
   instead of Serbian aggression.

Too bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence, which 
pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger
within the Islamic world, the consequences of which we cannot begin
to predict.  Later, Biden told a reporter why he spoke out:

   I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear
   this is a big deal... so they will understand.

and it IS a big deal.  By refusing the fundamental human right of
self-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Europe and the world have 
aided the Serbian aggression.  Moreover, the arms embargo has
forced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have 10 times more heavy
weaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined.  Under such
conditions, it is very easy for Serbs to play a ""divide-and-conquer""
game, and to get the Muslims and Croats (who have strong common
interests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression) 
to start fighting each other, which leads to their mutual catastrophe.

One final quote:  U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has
said in Rome last week that ""In practice, the embargo had the opposite
effect intended.  It made aggression certain.""

All diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace
while enforcing a 10:1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributed
to this tragedy.

This is completely false.


This is also false. What you need for multisession capability is
multisession capability -- which is based on the firmware and
electronics, not the drive speed. I'll admit, though, that I have
not seen a multisession capable drive that isn't double speed.


The above (1 & 2), proves 3 to be false.

The Apple CD300 is an excellent double-speed multi-session PhotoCD
capable drive. So are drives based on the slightly-faster Toshiba
XM3401. Some companies selling such drives are: Spin Peripherals (a
bargain at $499) and PLI (a company I hate) and Relax Technologies
(a company I know little about other than that they are  a longtime
player in Mac mailorder, which is usually a good sign). The NEC
CDR74 is also a good choice (NEC's own mechanism, I think). ClubMac
sells it for around $619.


Your welcome, ooh but now I see your from Germany. Most of the
mailorder info does you little good, I guess. If not:
Spin Peripherals -- 800-466-1200
Club Mac         -- 800-258-2622
Relax Tech       -- 510-471-6112

Nothing wrong with the Apple, though, which is based on a Sony
mechanism and speed-identical to the NEC. The Toshiba's speed
advantage is very slight: 20% in average access time (a minor plus)
and 10% in data transfer rate (a slightly more important plus).",1

Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves
and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.
But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to
him (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who
knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.

Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do)
as taught in Romans, but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James
in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spat-out'

"Although the $1 billion scheme is a fantasy (it's an old canard in the space
business called ""trolling for billionaires""), there is a good chance that a
much smaller program ($65 million) will pass the 103rd Congress. This is the
Back to the Moon bill, put together by the people who passed the Launch
Services Purchase Act. The bill would incent private companies to develop
lunar orbiters, with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding.
There is an aggregate cap on the bids of $65 million.
 
Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably
worse than having the government bankroll a $65 million program, as the Delta
Clipper program has shown (DC-X was funded by SDIO at $59 million). We have a
clear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade - as opposed to
simply wishing for our dreams to come true. Please support the Back to the
Moon bill.

Thanks for posting the references. I do not normally read t.p.m.,
and I posted my request for references because Jim's article
was cross-posted to soc.culture.jewish. Allegations of Jewish
disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are
one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture, and
rumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms
than blood libel. The stereotypes that pervade our culture create
cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. Therefore any
claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by
decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented.
If such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it has
not been documented before, such as s.c.j, a reference should be
given the first time it appears.  Now that the claim has been
documented, I regard the whole episode as disgusting and
shameful. Especially so because the official who failed to

I'll accept this as a compliment although I'm always a little paranoid
when visiting a.a, thanks. Yes I do know the extent of the statements
relevence, it's what I think of as human nature. I'm not sure it
undermines either religion or atheism since both claim special
knowledge about the Truth and since such claims are always suspect,
all we can learn from it is that humans are a very arrogant species.
My point is that we cannot ignore human nature when examining human

Are you sure it's not a problem caused by software?  I've seen this sort 
of effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an INIT 
conflict, for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video 
hardware.  Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the 
Q950 just sit there in the Finder?  You might also want to try changing to 
24-bit addressing (yes, I know you can't access your full 64 MB of RAM - 
it's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed 
then.

Another thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like 
QuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display.  This reprograms (some 
of) the video hardware registers and may allow sync to be restored.",1

I hate to belabor the obvious once again, but if there had been an Orbiter
emergency in the early stages of the original HST deployment mission, they
would have HAD to land with HST in the bay. 

Indeed they were worried about that.  One concern was the possibility that
they would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but one
that was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag.  
I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was
as short as six months.  In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upper
envelope of what the Shuttle can do.

I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought 
down for refurbishment.  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting,
cleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, in
addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment 
mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second 
time.  And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a 
few years as gyros and other components wear out.  Better to have two 
servicing missions in space (which could well happen) than to bring HST down 
and take it up again.",3

	Also, I do on rare occaisons, read Arab papers, but its hard

Ofranko. Coming from a self-exposed historical revisionist, a 
self-admitted anti-Muslim and a genocide apologist, Hamaza should 
take your drivel as a compliment. Furthermore, you even deny the 
obvious. There was a genocide of the Muslims carried out by order of 
the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government. Massacres of Muslims must be 
studied in detail, because they are the first modern example of the 
horrible crime of genocide. Blame must be apportioned to the Armenians
and their supporters for the murder of Muslims. The Turkish historic 
homeland, emptied of its native population until today, remains occupied 
by the x-Soviet Armenian Government. Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up 
the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory 
to this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime 
of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making 
reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

The following are the Jewish and Armenian sources on the cold-blooded
genocide perpetrated by the x-Soviet Armenian Government against 2.5
million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920. Still denying the obvious?

armies in 1914, ""History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (Volume

(London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316.

""In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city 
 of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, 
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan 
 on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized 
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during 
 the next two days.""

""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves.""

""With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
 World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.""

""...Meanwhile, Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final
 plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the 
 president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response:

 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the 
  glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian
  arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the
  Bosporus. Let, with Your will, great Majesty, the peoples remaining
  under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey
  who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new
  free life under the protection of Russia.'[155]

to strike the Ottomans from the rear, and the czar returned to St. Petersburg

""An Armenian state was organized at Van under Russian protection, and it 
 appeared that with the Muslim natives dead or driven away, it might be
 able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient Armenian
 civilization. An Armenian legion was organized 'to expel the Turks from
 the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted
 Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet.'[162] Thousands of Armenians from
 Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new 
 Armenian state...By mid-July there were as many as 250,000 Armenians
 crowded into the Van area, which before the crisis had housed and fed
 no more than 50,000 people, Muslim and non-Muslim alike.[163]""

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

 Transcaucasia).

In 1920, '0' percent Turk. 

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead.""

Although I don't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily I disagree. Any
discrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the
sole qualification for religious membership is racial. This is not the
case for Israel although it might get a little closer than, say, Islam.
This of course raises the vexed question of Church AntiSemitism. Jews
have been heavily discriminated against on the grounds of religion in
many Christian countries. If we take Russia as an example Jews were
seriously persecuted but that persecution in the eyes of the Church
and State stopped at the baptismal font. Officially anyway. If a Jew
converted there were no legal barriers in his way (that I know of anyway.)
Peter the Great's Interior Minister came from such a convert background.
Can we then claim that the Russian Orthodox did not teach AntiSemitism
and was not AntiSemitic? Similarly for the Roman Catholic Church? I
suspect so as this is not a racial 'taint' but one based on belief
and AS is after all a form of racism. Well maybe not. What is
AntiSemitism then if not something racially based? I wonder if Hitler
killed converts of 'pure' German blood. Does anyone know one way or
the other?

According to this reasoning there are no rights, at least none that I can think 
of....

Let's see.  Do I have a right to unpolluted air?  No, because the majority
drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process.

Do I have the right to clean water?  I guess not, by the same reasoning.
I could go on with these examples for a long time....

Look at Nazi Germany.  Because of the majority, Jews, homosexuals, blacks,
and others that were different had no rights.  In fact they were terrorized, 
imprisoned, and slaughtered.  In this country did blacks have the right to be
free from slavery?  I guess not, because the majority said that slavery was 
good for them.

I think that a right has a moral imperative.  If a law, imposed by the majority,
is immoral, one should not follow it.  In fact, one should do everything in
his/her power to stop it. Of course, that doesn't mean that I would lose all
common sense to break the law, just because I thought it was immoral.  I pay
my Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Government
taking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.
This is precisely the point I am trying to make.  We should _persude_ people 
by logic, pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all have
equal rights in all aspects of life, including adequate housing, food, and
medical care.  I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of
beauty and joy is also necessary.  That is why I consider an uncluttered
night sky a right.

Have you ever been out in the desert, away from local lights, and most people?
The sky is dark and transparent.  The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail
than you thought possible.  The beauty and wonder takes your breath away.

Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto, say in L.A. Due to light pollution
you have never seen a dark sky.  You might in fact never, not in your whole
life, ever see the majesty of the night sky.  Every where around you, you see
squalor, and through your life runs a thread of dispair. What is there to live
for?  

I admit these two scenarios are extreme examples, but I have seen both.
I, for one, need dreams and hopes, and yes, beauty, as a reason for living.
That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right.

be willing to bet lots of you out there have SIMMS with either soft
or hard errors on them and you don't even know about it, but every once
in awhile those bad SIMMS just makes your life hell.

with a SIMM hardware tester...and NO I don't mean the simple little software
programs that you can run in your machine.  SIMMS are complicated little
beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively.

If any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices
which are not cheap, write me back.  They make life a little bit easier, and
besides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity

a few weeks ago i was in the DMV with ken. i was standing in a mile long

wondering why everybody there looked to be about the social calibur of

required our conferring attentions. he came over and stood in line with me 
while we watched her fill out some forms and then we noticed a little kid 
about 4 years old reach over the bench and touch our helmets, one at a time. 
i didn't particularly mind, and neither did ken (that the kid was touching 
our helmets that is). but the helmets weren't on the most stable of 
platforms, so ken scooted over there to resettle them and as soon as he 
touched the helmets, mother of said child started shrieking at her kid ""YOU

been either a Russian ""snowfox"" type thingey (for the lifting bodies)
or something like MMI's Space Van (or Boeing's TSTO, or the airbreathing
TSTO the military is allegedly _using_ now that probably cost less
to develop than the shuttle does to fly for a year).


Keep that attitude, and it'll be a couple centuries before we get real
access to space, unless another country without all that baggage comes
along and kicks our ass in the space race.


Or NASA HQ. That doesn't give the rest of the program plausible deniability
if we deceide that it wasn't worth the money we've spent, which is by now
probably a lot more than Apollo.


Yes, but it gets sold on the basis of the political statements.
You're saying basically that it met the engineering specs (which is
questionable, IMHO) so it's a success, never mind that you couldn't
get the funding the shuttle eats with those engineering specs in
a thousand years.


You can get hypersonic flight data with an X-15 or a follow-on X-15
type vehicle for much less.

And economics and engineering are interchangable; engineering in the
absense of economics is basically just physics, and in terms of physics,
the shuttle looks like a failure next to the X-15.

The shuttle program has a bad record. I _once_ had hopes for the
shuttle program. By now I know those hopes were false. 

All I have for DC-X and similar and dissimilar experimental vehicles
are hopes. But at least I know they aren't false hopes yet.

I did support the shuttle, way back when. It didn't do nearly what
it was supposed to. It's time to move on to something that might do
the job of orbital delivery better. Or at all.





We don't want to learn how to operate on orbit. It launches, it
shoves out the payload, it lands. It doesn't waste payload hauling
up and down EDO pallets and the like.

The only thing to be learned from shuttle is how *not* to build a
launcher.

Finally: that bit about the ""proven"" shuttle. Are you hoping you can
tell a lie enough times and get someone to believe it?


How much science and technology could have been done is the money spent
on shuttle had been spent differently?

Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on
faith alone, which by its nature is without justification.  That
is what I mean by the word ``faith'': belief without justification, or
belief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational)
justification.

For example, when someone says that God exists, that they don't know
why they believe God exists, they can just feel it, that's faith.

Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based
on new information, or increased mental faculty.

Faith and dogma are irrational.  The faith and dogma part of any religion
are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim that
faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If that
makes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy rather
than a religion, I can live with that.  Science is not a religion,
because there is no faith nor dogma.

Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher
is not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.

A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is
a special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore,
to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence
of That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma
comes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example
of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.
Sure, interpretations of what ``God said'' are changed to satisfy the
needs of society, but when God says something, that's it.  It was said,
and that's that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if the
interpretations are flawed.

Science, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a
BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma.
A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to
suit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND,
*AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs
are deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving
the beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect
the best information currently available.  That's the only rational
thing to do.  That's good philosophy.

Can you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed,
and new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How many
scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding
of everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religion
views its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations of
those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which
conflicts with them.

It's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn't require
a good rational justification of the killing.  I don't consider
``he's Jewish'', or ``he was born of Jewish parents'', or
``this document says he's Jewish'' to be good rational justification.

I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little
justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an.
In Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. 
Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there
is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have
been generally left to believe or not believe as they will.

However, when an apostate makes attacks upon ""God and
His Messenger"" the situation changes. Now the charge of
apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps 
charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person 
makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public
attacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the
situation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads
slander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation
changes. The punishments vary according to the situation
the apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated
apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie's case.

There is a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation
and being in the situation where someone unilaterally
wages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. 
against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm 
to Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could
be said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is
a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two
clearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange
prisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated
individuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, 
the unilateral attack and the spreading of ""fasad"" that 
would apply in the case of Rushdie.

The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an 
offensive book (banning the book is secondary) -
a full set of circumstances following the publication of
the book come into play as well, including the deaths of many
Muslims, and Rushdie's (and his publishers) Media games.




I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe
that one of the Qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.
Every verse in the Qur'an has a corresponding ""circumstance of
revelation"" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the
verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance
in which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say
that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the
Muslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when
they were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life
situations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can
all be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal
relationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that
arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how
each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.
It is not necessarily a simple ""this or that"" process. There may
be many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in
which a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters
impinge on the situation.

In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur'an.
The Qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must
entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.
If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each
person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.
However, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to
the
State, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,
the dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there 
are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one 
should achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of 
these requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:

""...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating
verse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,
and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between
a permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of
Meccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances 
of revelation, and does not understand the technical words of
the Qur'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the
knowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and
delaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from
the deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning
from the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,
the disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,
and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the
subsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the
detailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the
duties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and
does not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those
coming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know
the Qur'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur'an...."".

Based on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur'anic
verses (""Why should not a company from every group remain behind 
to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn 
people when they return to them, so that they may beware."" (9:122)),
a science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements
for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on
matters of law and religion) are many. I've listed a few major 
divisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these
headings.

- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).
- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.
- Logic (mantiq)
- A knowledge of Hadiths
- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)
- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur'an, Sunnah, Consensus,
Reasoning)

The study of Qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:
- discussion of imperatives (awamir)
- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)
- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)
- discussion of unconditional and conditional
- discussion of tacit meanings
- discussion of the abstract and the clear
- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated

The principles of Application of the law involves:
- principles of exemption
- principles of precaution
- principles of option
- principles of mastery

The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process
in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter
of looking at one verse and one hadith. 

Now no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference
between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is
clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the
""The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as 
long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,
and wealth of this world."" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: ""O Messenger
of God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?"" He (S.A.) replied:
""By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for
your religion and shun them."" I do not yet know enough about the Imams
of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies
to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.

The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as ""The fortress of Islam"". My only
point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into
play a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is 
delineated in the Qur'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise
are praised in both the Qur'an and hadith - those who without the requisite
knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion 
are cautioned.

The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this
group, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,
apostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least
base their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a
heretic
because he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of
creating a straw man and then beating him.

"[ . . .]

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you
phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of ""right""
and ""wrong"" (or ""correct/incorrect"" or ""true/false"") belong to the
domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no
sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is
legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).

Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives
of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.
One can certainly ask if a percept is ""right"" (correct, true,
veridical) or ""wrong"" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little
sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is
strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can
certainly ask that question about motives.

Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:
they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.

Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with
the first part (that the ""rightness"" of a moral position is a
meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is
irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that
one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make
value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the ""correctness""
of the position.

Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is
that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,
neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold
different moral values (feelings).",0

standards generally asserted in this group, the distinction between
eyewitnesses and others is hollow, since nobody can be shown to be an
eyewitness, or indeed, even shown to be the author of the text.)

There is no evidence that the ""original"" texts of either the OT or the NT
are largely lost over time in a sea of errors, ""corrections"", additions and
deletions.  In the case of the NT, the evidence is strongly in the other
direction: the Textus R. and the Nestle-Aland text do not differ on more

Oboy, this is exciting. First you discuss your non-existent literature
tastes, then your fantasies, and now your choices of historical revisionism.
Are you related to 'Arromdians' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and
Revisionism Triangle?

The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' 
which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference 
to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the 
existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the 
essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger 
Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the 
three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of 
themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized 
according to the agreements? 

It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece 
and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.
The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish
minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with 
the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,
in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,
virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and
other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting
religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek 
governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective
of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although
the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in
Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing
its religious leaders. Talk about democracy.

The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic 
convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an 
attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a 
violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' 
Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection 
of historical monuments. 

The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new 
churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward 
Hellenizing the region.

The longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' in titles
and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have
ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, 
the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti 
Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks
in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been 
active until 1984. But they were first told to remove
the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official
papers and then eventually close down. This is also the 
final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.

Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating 
the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their 
findings were published in a report titled 

 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'

The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the 
Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, 
the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in 
Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against 
the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the 
Lausanne Convention. 


HELSINKI WATCH: ""PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE""

Ankara (A.A)  In a 15-page report  of the ""Helsinki Watch""  it is
stated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced
with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being
implemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end.

The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government
should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of
minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and
in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the ""Turkish
Minority"" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify
themselves as 'Turks'.

GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS

The  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek
state is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish
minority with Turkey.

Pointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is
called ""Greek""  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the
minority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with
Turkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western
Trace are also Turkish.""

Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in
Western  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement
signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey
in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.

Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.
SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,
Faikoglu said.  ""In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented
Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European
countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal
rights.""

On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are
predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical
reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign
powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by
cooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was
will to improve relations with Greece.

MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.

Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in
Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a
Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.

  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)
have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in
an Athenian magazine.

  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly
magazine  ""ENA""  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as
Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would
field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek
general election.

  Bulev said in the interview: ""I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.""
Sideropoulos said  in the  article that ""Greece  should recognise
Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations
against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the
border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC
are falling.""

  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court
summons,  was   that  ""they  have   spread...intentionally  false
information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the
citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the
international interests of the country (Greece).""

  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a
Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to
1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely
concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state
if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.

  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned
Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian
villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in
1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5
million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000
in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.

  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian
human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a
few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in
the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced
the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of
Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the
majority of ethnic Macedonians live.

  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in
which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,
especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its
northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.

  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned
Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who
largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the
US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections
are over.

If one really understands Islam, it is not strange that Sufism is
associated with it.  In fact, Sufism is (in general) seen as the ""inner
dimension"" of Islam.

One of the ""roots"" of the word ""Islam"" is ""submission"" -- ""Islam""
denotes submission to God.  Sufism is the most complete submission to
God imaginable, in ""annihilating"" oneself in God.

Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, 
the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated 
in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion
and national origin?

Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the 
hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only the killing of 
innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia. 
They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of Ottoman 
Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide 
as acting with a 

  'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a 
   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' 

History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate 
the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the 
Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including 
U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy 
as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of 
the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the 
extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor 
those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. 

The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,
beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people
during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy
was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian 
territories.

The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and
their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.
The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and
perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian 
Government.

The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were
Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,
Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

Well, no, during the original deployment mission the HST aperture door was
not opened until after the Shuttle had landed.  

I presume that during a re-boost mission HST would be berthed in the orbiter
with the orbiter bay doors shut; but still there would be lots of contamination
worries.  I understand that the EVA suits are one of the hardest things to 
keep clean.

Pardon me? Your ignorance cramps my conversation. Although the administrative 
mechanism was a strictly centralized one, the Ottoman Empire 'was a classical 
example of a pluralist social order.' The 'millet system' was the mechanism 
which shaped the social order of the multi-national Ottoman Empire and stood 
behind its continuity. As a matter of fact, because Islamic principles 
were in force in the Ottoman Empire, it was natural to use religious 
criteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted 
the Empire. The 'millet' system began to be based on ethnicity in the 
19th century under the influence of nationalism. Sousa writes of the 
existence of thirteen communities in the Ottoman Empire in addition to 
the Muslim 'millet' in 1914. These were: (1) Greeks attached to the 
Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul; (2) Catholics or Latins who were 
remnants of Genoese and Venetian merchants; (3) Gregorian Armenians 
attached to a Patriarchate in Istanbul; (4) Catholic Armenians; (5) Syrian 
Catholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (6) Chaldean Catholics 
attached to a Patriarchate in Mosul; (7) Syrian Jacobites attached to a 
Patriarchate in Mardin; (8) Protestants; (9) Melchites attached to a 
Patriarchate in Damascus; (10) Hebrews of two rites; (11) Bulgarian 
Catholics attached to the Bulgarian Exarch; (12) Maronites; and (13) 
Nestorians.[1] Scholars who studied the pluralistic social structure 
outlined briefly above, concluded that the social order of the Ottoman 
Empire fit the framework of the 'Mosaics Theory.'[2]

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

""Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar
 section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors
 were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great 
 fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they
 smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last
 Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror,
 unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and
 the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished.""

p. 109 (second paragraph).

""As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative
 experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself
 incompetent to rule by legitimate means.

 The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and
 outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing
 body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to 
 do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their 
 fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days.

 The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was,
 as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking
 the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and
 condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method 
 of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the
 condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back
 of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of
 those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became
 a common way of paying debts.""

p. 203 (first paragraph).

""A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the
 point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock 
 and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him
 sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising
 it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey!
 Slodkey!' (Sweet.)""

p. 203 (second paragraph).

""One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the 
 ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about
 it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children.
 The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed
 sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and
 other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the
 dead.""

p. 204 (first paragraph).

""I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of
 a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make
 my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy
 that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of
 a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a
 Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her
 throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a
 year old.""

p. 118.

""Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart
 jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging
 them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the
 carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms.
 Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they
 sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot.

 Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading
 oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians 
 concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and
 scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety.

 This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by 
 barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene....
 That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted
 and completely destroyed.""

p. 192.

""Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the
 retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered
 into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores
 that had been left by the Turks.""

p. 193.

""Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks. Their villages
 were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country.""

p. 195.

""The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order
 of diminishing intensity: Tartars, Kurds and Russians."" 

p. 218. (First and second paragraphs)

""Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians 
 did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners, 
 the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace 
 actions expected and accepted as a matter of course.

 I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground,
 in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless
 and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the
 heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands,
 and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with
 their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself.""

p. 133 (first paragraph)

""In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who
 had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians
 abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of
 these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the
 brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some,
 mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method
 employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after
 crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw.""

p. 19 (first paragraph)

""The Tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of
 ruins. It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. The same 
 fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi.""

p. 22 (second paragraph)

""Many of our men had served in the Russian Army, and were trained soldiers.
 We Armenians were rich and possessed arms. Tartars had never received
 military training. They were poor, and possessed few arms beyond knives.
 ...Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village, the revolution
 in Russia was suppressed.""

p. 97 (third paragraph)

""Within a few years, following the beginning of the movement, an invisible
 government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish 
 Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government. This secret 
 government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called
 'Mauserists' (professional killers) to enforce its decrees.""

p. 98 (first paragraph)

""The Dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the Turkish 
 Government.""

p. 98 (third paragraph)

""...the Dashnacks engineered a general revolt of Armenians in Turkish
 Armenia under the mistaken belief that European nations would intervene
 and secure independence for Turkish Armenia.""

p. 99 (second paragraph)

""The Dashnacks were fanatics.""           

p. 99 (third paragraph)

""The Dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their 
 revolutionary activities into the Russian province. They instituted 
 a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing
 contributions to the party funds from rich Armenians. A wealthy
 man would be assessed a stipulated sum. Refusal to pay brought upon
 him a sentence of death. 

 Every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without 
 question. If a man were to be assassinated, lots might be drawn to
 select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the
 'mauserists' of the party.""

p. 130 (first paragraph)

""...in moments of victory against Turks and Kurds or Tartars, they 
 [Armenians] have been remorseless in seeking vengeance.""

p. 130 (third paragraph)

""The city was a scene of confusion and terror. During the early days of 
 the war, when the Russian troops invaded Turkey, large numbers of the 
 Turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the Russian 
 advance.""

p. 159 (second paragraph)

""I made a cannon, a huge gun to lift which required four men. I made balls
 for it. With my cannon the Armenians could knock down any of the Tartar
 houses and so they were able to drive the Tartars out.""

p. 181 (first paragraph)

""The Tartar villages were in ruins.""

p. 189 (third paragraph)

""The dead Tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood, his 
 beard still setaceous and now crimsoned.""

"Okay, the earth has a magnetic field (unless someone missed something?)

Okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field, it produces electricty..

Now the question. Can you use electricity to power a space/low earth orbit
vehicle? and i fyou can, can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power
it??
Can the idea of a ""dragless"" satellite be used in part to create the electrical

After all the dragless satellite is (I might be wrong), a suspended between to
pilons, the the pilons compensate for drag.. I think I know what I want to say,
just not sure how to say it..

A dragless satellite sounds interestingly enough liek a generator.

Space advertisement in LOW Earth Orbit is very short term -- on the
order of a few years before the orbit decays.  (Higher orbits last
longer.)  Advertisers will certainly be aware of the environmental
aspects of their advertising.  Fred's argument is roughly akin to
saying that it's bad to cut down trees, so we shouldn't advertise in
newspapers.  Think that through, Fred.

Picture this: Our space billboard is a LARGE inflatable structure,
filled with ""bio-degradable"" foam instead of gas.  It scoops up space
debris as it orbits, thus CLEANING the space environment and bringing
you The Pause That Refreshes at the same time.  Because of the large
drag coefficient, it will de-orbit -- safely burning up -- within a
year.

Embedded in the foam structure is a small re-entry vehicle, which does
not burn up during entry.  It contains the electronics and propulsion
system (which may be refurbished and re-used) as well as space science
experiments proposed and built by high school students in
advertiser-sponsored science fairs.

Advertisers buy time on the billboard, whose surface is made up of
tiny mirrors controlled by the avionics package.  The avionics can
reconfigure the mirrors to reflect different messages at different
parts of the globe.  Clever programming allows different languages
to every country.

During orbital night, the mirrors turn perpendicular to the surface,
and small lights are revealed.  The lights spell out messages for all
to see.

                               POST-LAUNCH
                           April 23 - 29, 1993

SPACECRAFT

1.  On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were
performed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43
(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results 
indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground
station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.

2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the
Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the
spacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS
(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to
preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a
source of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).

4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was
performed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of
two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the
spacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.

6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay
Antenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.
The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately
20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18
degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back
to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the
antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The
RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had
increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.

     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was
uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,
a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on
May 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the
Two-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test
mini-sequence.

7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under
stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees
from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,
back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of
the slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was
at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4
degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time
commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.

9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change
(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN
(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special
anomaly team.

10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours
           Time To Initiation - 203 hours


GDS (Ground Data Systems):

1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took
place April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went
well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN
(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was
successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with
DSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).

2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development
Office (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current
Project and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going
cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months
accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant
schedule changes or significant problems were reported.


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows:

	Distance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)
	Distance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)
	Heliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km

Well, as I remember Jacoby's ""Mythmaker"" talks about this to cite
one source -- but I'm not sure if all Christians have read this book.
In addition my social experiences is from being raised and educated
as a Lutheran, having a lot of Christian friends, and I even
have played in two Christian rock bands!

So, over to you, do you have any counter claims, sources et 
rest that shows that Christianity does not have the concept
of a social promise that is independent on the social status?

[ Deletia; in case anybody hadn't noticed, Frank and I are debating
  ""objective morality"", and seemingly hitting semantics. ]


      It may be that, being a non-native English-speaker, I've
misunderstood your usage of ""objective"", and tried to debate something
you don't assert; my apologies. I'm at a loss to imagine what you really
do mean, though.


      Wrong point. The age of the universe has no direct effect on
humanity's sticking power, in the way the moral system of a society can
have.

      I'm saying the Universe has a ""real age"", because I see evidence
for it; cosmology, astronomy and so on. I say this age is independent of
people's opinions of it, because I know different people have a lot of
different opinions in the matter, yet empirical tests consistently seem
to give roughly the same results.


      I can't see how it does that. Put a creationist to the task of
performing the tests and calculations, see to it (s)he makes no blatant
errors in measuring or calculating, and the result of the test will be
the same.


      Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their
opinion. If those tests were just my opinion, then their own tests
(which would then be their opinion) would contradict mine, even if we
conducted said tests in identical manner, no? They don't, which I take
as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them.


      Map the activity of nerves and neural activity, if you mean
physical pain. You have a sharp point, I'll give you that; but you still
haven't given me a way to quantify morality.


      We agree. Hypotheses, however, can change; I hold that there is no
""ultimate hypothesis of morality"" towards which these changes could
gravitate, but that they could be changed in any way imaginable,
producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes.


      ""Better"" and ""worse"" are (almost?) always defined in the context
of a moral system. Your prediction will _always_ be correct, *within*
*that* *moral* *system*. What you need now is an objective definition of
""good"" and ""bad""; I wish you luck.


      Isn't that what _you're_ doing, when assuming an ""objectively
real"" morality? Besides, what _exactly_ is provably wrong with my
statement?


      Claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive
claim? Besides, I think I _can_ lend some credence to my claim; ponder
different individuals, both fully functional as human beings and members
of society, but yet with wildly different moral codes. If morality was

them from different societies; say, an islamic one and some polynesian
matrilineal system, for example (if such still exist).

      One thing is ""good"" under some circumstances, because we wish to
achieve some goal, for some reason. Other times we wish to do something
else, and that thing is no longer so clearly ""good"" at all.

      Some things are hard to make ""good"", because we'd seldom if ever
wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into. Still,
the Aztecs were doing fine until the Spaniards wiped them out.

      I almost always know what ""good"" means; sometimes I even know why.
I never claim this ""good"" is thereby fixed in stone, immutable.

      Yes, me too, and I've tried a thing or two down that line; it
doesn't look good for objective values to me at all.

I don't think a reboost exercise is analogous to a shuttle landing/launch
in terms of stresses/misalignments/etc.  I would think of the reboost as
a gentile push, where a landing, then launch as two JOLTS which would
put more mechanical stress on the instruments.  Additionally, there might
be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden
landing.  Finally, probably some thought went into possible contamination 
problems if the instruments came back to earth.

Of course, the cost of two shuttle launches _is_ a good reason to avoid
something that might be done in one shuttle launch.  Here's hoping

for most atrocities against Muslims in the region) and FORGIVE GERMANY ITSELF

"RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28, 1992

		WHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE

I. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC

	Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to
panic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right
with God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your 
only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the 
Tribulation.  ""But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be 
saved."" - Matthew 24:13

II. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION

	The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of
the rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as ""the time of Jacob's
(Israel's) trouble"" (Jere 30:7) and ""Daniel's Seventieth Week"" (Dan 9), this 
period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.

III. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM

	Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community 
(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will
be tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable 
possession during the Tribulation.

IV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE

	Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it
is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can
quote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, 
Revelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to
unfold before you.  

V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE

	Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray 
and pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual 
strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the
sake of Christ.  

VI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED
ONES DIE AS MARTYRS

	After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he
will institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,
or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be
useless.  ""And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and 
slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that
no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, 
or the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding
calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number
is 666"" - Revelation 13:16-18.  
	The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of 
humanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed
in the past, such as the Holocaust.
[or maybe the crusades? -M]
You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's
rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) ""...I saw
under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and
for the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of 
them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, 
until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be
killed as they were, was completed."" Revelation 6:9, 11.
	His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image
or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ ""...And I saw the souls of 
those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of 
God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark
on their foreheads or on the hands."" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every
form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor
will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, 
torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take
the mark.  
	If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,
you will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.
[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]
You cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and
gain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake
of Fire.  ""...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his 
mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of
the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His 
indignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the 
presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb."" -Revelation 
14:9-10 

[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to
the first 5,000 at the stadium --M] 

VII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL

	Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government
until the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is 
important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are
extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.
	The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or
mountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least
populated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay 
attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.
[""As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep
into our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school
closings"" --M] 
Store water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without
the mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste
from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.
[Get a good water filter. --M]
Bring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,
batteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to 
survive and live off the land as the pioneers did.

VIII. TRUST NO ONE
	
	There will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's
government.  Be on the lookout.
[Perot supporters take note --M]

IX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST

	It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,
for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will
bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel 
11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a
half years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be 
physically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and 
personality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic
expert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which
he will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural 
power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will
be deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.
[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]
	The antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who
will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  
All who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and
a half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.

X. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!

	The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of
Christ.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you 
will be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  
	Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of 
your sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take
the mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or
remain saved, but this time you will have to be ""faithful unto death.""

	May God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!

I have never said that only humans are the only beings which are
sufficiently sentient to have intentions.   In fact, I have explicitly
said that I am perfectly happy to consider that some animals *are*
capable of forming intentions.

What I am objecting to is considering programmed or instinctive
behaviour to have moral significance, since, it seems to me, 
such behaviour does *not* involve intention.


That's not the point.   The point is whether the implementor thinks
*at all*.    The issue is not whether thinking produces opinion A
or opinion B, but whether thinking takes place, period.


Since humans are part of nature, are not all human actions ""natural"".

Or perhaps you're going to throw in a definition of ""natural"" that
will allow us to describe some actions as ""natural"" and some as 
""not natural"".   If so, what is the definition?



Sure they do, as multiple posters have show you.   Sharks, for example,
eat wounded sharks.   I've personally seen cats eat their newborn.

Are you in some kind of denial?   People give you example after example,
and you go off the air for a week, and then pop up claiming that it 
never happened.    It's very strange.


See what I mean.   Here we go again.   What do we have to do: write

"Throughout the years of the Israel/Arab-Palestinian conflict, the internal
Palestinian popultation has found itself essentially relegated to the
lower tiers of the economy. Given the major kinds of positions required
by the Israeli and the ""Palestinian"" economy, there are essentially two
different ones existing side by side aren't holding down many of the ""
skilled"" positions. So, when Gaza has to operate on its own, there are 
few residents trained to fill the need for middle and upper management.",4
"

I think C.S. Lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the
world is flat.

However, this argument goes both ways. Pretend someone telling Plato that
it is highly probable that people do not really have souls; their minds
and their consciousness are just something their brains make up, and
their brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in 
voluntarly actions. I don't think Plato would have been happy with this,
and neither would Paul, although Paul's ideas were quite different.
However, if you would _read_ what we discuss in this group, and not
just preach, you would see that there currently is much evidence in
favour of these statements.

The same applies to the theory of natural selection, or other sacred
cows of Christianity on our origins and human nature. I don't believe
in spirits, devils or immortal souls any more than in gods.


Ah, you said it. You believe what you want to. This is what I had assumed
all along. 


You might be as well planting Satan's seeds, ever thought of this?
Besides, you haven't yet explained why we must believe so blindly,
without any guiding light at all (at least I haven't noticed it).
I don't think this is at all fair play on god's part. 

Your argument sounds like a version of Pascal's Wager. Please read the
FAQ, this fallacy is discussed there.

	How much RAM?  I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8?  What do you
think?
	Ok, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard
(extended) is 160.30. Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time
great wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is
just a reliable?  Price?
	Printers:  One color printer we are presently leaning towrds the
Thermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i (Probably the e as we are going to limit
access so we don't needed the i's networkability)  So, what do you think in
terms of color printers?  Different brand?  Kind (Dye Sublimation?  Ink Jet?) 
Price? Companies?  1800 #s?  Also, we are looking to get a laser printer or
such to network into the whole lab for noraml printing.  The fornt runner is
the Apple Pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650. 
Suggestions?  We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through
and they know nothing about it for the most part. It has to be reliable, easy
to maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc).
	Finally, and this is my little dig into the Project. What about netting

There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like
particles and fields, not to mention atmospheric phenomena.  However,
there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network.
To be precise, there is no particular plan, period.  This is a large
part of the problem.  In this context, it's not surprising that unexciting
but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time.  The closest
approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the
occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier
mission like Galileo or Cassini.


It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be
worth monitoring, and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly
without new propulsion technology (something the planetary community
has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for).  The combined need to
arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time, and then kill nearly
all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit, is beyond what can
reasonably be done with current (that is, 1950s-vintage) propulsion.


Most of this can be done just about as well from Earth.  The few things
that can't be, can be done better from a Voyager-like spacecraft that is
*not* constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet.",3

   Diaspora 'a cancer'
   ------------------- by Julian Kossoff and Lindsay Schusman in:
   Jewish Chronicle, London, 22. Dec. 1989

   Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,
   launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth
   Council meeting in North London, last week.

   The diaspora, he claimed, ""was the cancer connected to the main
   tissue of the Jewish people"". He was scathing about its failure to
   act before the Holocaust.


   [ deleted for bravity ]


   Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,
   unlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the
   country they lived in, he said.

   He warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish
   people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in
   literary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English
   language.

I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, I want to
answer this for their, as well as everyone else's information.  What these
people are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today.

It is called labview by National Instruments.  IT is a wonderful object
oriented graphical programming language.  IT has been implemented on
both Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes.  IT is fare superior to any programming
approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software
development time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent.  This program is
not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis 
capability.

Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist? It is a great
idea but look out there at what is available today.  The Hydrogen leak on
the Shuttle was found using this software. All SSME control and simulation
studies, along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW.  There
are tons of applications, with the ability to create ""virtual"" instruments
that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires.  With the
addition of IEEE-488 support, the computer becomes a virtual control station,
allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation. With serial
I/O support that instrument can be anywhere.  The ground control software
for the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach.",3

   This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no,
   anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far
   as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.
   That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution
   to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well
   known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)
   are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...

Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right
energy, except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlation
with galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting
all the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of
baryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a
plasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating
enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it
happens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to
make tight-binaries of neutron stars.

Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a
neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but
that uses pretty far-out physics.

My point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance, so
GRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can't
rule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event which
converts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black
holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets
aren't quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which
modifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of these
mechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks, if the ""Tunguska Meteorite""
was a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likely
to be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet
collisions matches the GRB rate well.

The fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oort
cloud isn't a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them
out.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the
right distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible
to match that up with the distribution of GRB's.  If they got the
wrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can't constrain any Oort-
cloud GRB's at all.",3

I don't know.  Does anyone in NASA land know how much fuel is
budgeted for the altitude change?

Henry,  any figures on the mass  (full)  for the EDO pallet  plus
it's dry weight?  How about for the dry mass of Bus-1?  it was
being de-classified as i checked last.

Also, I need.

1)  current orbital parameters of HST 

2)  projected  orbital parameters after re-boost.

3)  Discovery's  DRY weight

4) HST's Dry weight.



So how long do they need to train?  a year?  2 years?  somehow
I think 2-3 moths should be adequate.


Also because they significantly lacked on-orbit EVA experience.  
The HST is designed for on-orbit servicing.  it should be a lot easier.


There comes a time in every project, to kill the management.

They can if neccessary, re-schedule the  HST mission.  December is
not a drop dead date, unlike say the LDEF retrieval mission.  



I suspect, the BUS-1, may not have enough basic thrust for the HST
re-boost.  it mayu need bigger tanks,  or bigger thrusters.


My understanding is the Second HST servicing mission is not
a contingency.  My understanding is the mission  needs both
a new FOC  and work on the electrical system,  plus
another re-boost.   


Somehow, i think the cost of an expendable SMT will be less then
$500 million.

and the extra stuff is real cheap.  NASA has lots of suits,  MMU's,
and the EDO pallets are re-usable.  Oh, one double magnum of champagne,
now there's a couple hundred bucks.





That door has cycled, X times already.  Once after massive G loading.

CO2, or H2O  would manage to contaminate the mirror,  anything
that goes to vapor state, shouldn't adhere to the mirror.

"A few random thoughts on riding with a passenger:

There's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power, having taken
passengers very occasionally on the small (125 etc) bikes I used to
ride in the UK it was hard ! I'm now riding a GS1100 and that's great,
even moving from my freinds GSX600 I was riding recently. This may be due
in part to the fact that neither I, nor my regular passengers, are
particularly slimline !

I always tell passengers, stay in line with the bike on corners, that makes
their movements predictable.

My regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all,
I don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods.
Again that may be biased by the fact that I've had a couple of new passengers
(a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight,
making any kind of maneuvering difficult.

I've also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves and
shifts their weight a bit. I recently took a work collegue to a meeting (about
a 1 hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also
sitting very still and getting a sore back.

"Yesterday, a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle
dealer. It has been a while since he last rode (>10 years), and I myself
have never bought a new bike from a dealer. What follows is an experience
of that visit and of an observation of ""SQUILDLY"" behavior by other 
customers and/or sales personel:

BACKGROUND:

I ride with a group of friends, who mainly are into ""cruiser"" type bikes. My
friend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones. He
wanted to see what the new ones were going for, so we happened upon a dealer
that sold both Suzuki and Yamaha. 

The place was fairly busy, so we browsed a bit. We happened upon a few 
Intruders, most of which had SOLD signs on. My friend had been bitten.

Well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat, I 
moseid on outside. The next thing I know, I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in.
I could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat, oakley, IQ <40),
but I won't. Well they went inside, I didn't think much of it. I figured
to each his own. I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs
firmly implanted into my friends back,  when I noticed the ""hormone gang""
talking to other salesdroids/managers. Lot's of laughter, jokes etc. No big
deal.

Here is the part that concerned me. The ""HG"" and those shop personel that were
not busy with customers went back out, where said ""HG"" members fired up their
rides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. At this point,
one decided to see how much rubber  a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive.

SQUIDS, I thought to myself. BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids/manager
not only condoned this behavior, but encourged it, to the point were they
were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely
as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike, seemed rather hormonal about this display, and urged her
""pilot"" to quickly catch up. The others followed, making sure there Kerkers
could be heard as well as felt.

I felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of those
in cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot and
damning all those on two wheels. Needless to say, my friend felt a little
uncomfortable and we left. 

I will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear my
anger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an open
mind and doesn't associate me with them. ",2

        To the North Pole!

        On June 2 and 7, 1983, two of the Soviet Union's mighty PROTON 
    rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan 
    Republic.  Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe 
    for the planet Venus. 

        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing
    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the
    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic
    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core
    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of
    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by
    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels
    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large
    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The
    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger 
    to properly transmit this information to Earth. 

        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed
    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)
    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a
    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by 
    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus'
    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). 

        The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over
    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects 
    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the
    VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations 
    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the 
    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern
    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or 
    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially 
    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.

        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 
    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, 
    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a 
    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around 
    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA 
    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus' 
    first polar-circling spacecraft.

        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 
    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north
    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers 
    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  
    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over 
    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back 
    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took 
    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions 
    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers 
    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.

        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more
    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, 
    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, 
    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the 
    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean 
    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the 
    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids 
    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) 
    across, due to Venus' very dense atmosphere.

        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists
    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes' 
    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the 
    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest 
    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American 
    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell 
    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern ""continent"" of Ishtar Terra.  

        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about
    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later
    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar
    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-
    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be 
    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan 
    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even 
    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet 
    probes maintained that distinction.

        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted
    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the 
    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's
    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about
    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few
    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating 
    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds 
    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) 
    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty 
    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees 
    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.

        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were 
    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at 
    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to 
    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control
    gas to perform the operation.  

        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving 
    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six 
    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an 
    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.

        Venus by Balloon

        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting 
    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of 
    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of 
    the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)
    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint 
    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, 
    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.

        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, 
    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full 
    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe 
    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.

        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named
    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei
    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft 
    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one 
    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  

        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to 
    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.
    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from
    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists 
    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such 
    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  

        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar 
    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall 
    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice 
    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar 
    encounter.

        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and
    Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not
    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a
    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical
    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the 
    comet, while Japan's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and 
    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. 

        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet
    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel
    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget
    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to
    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of 
    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter 
    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor 
    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.

        The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building
    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify
    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an 
    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,
    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of 
    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the 
    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. 
    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the 
    location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive 
    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.

        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA
    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander
    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the
    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers
    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released
    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)
    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had
    successfully arrived. 

        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was
    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a
    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen
    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as
    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat
    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment
    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,
    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for
    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special
    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which
    permeated the planet's atmosphere. 

        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just
    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag 
    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened 
    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  
    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as 
    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  
    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar 
    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists 
    had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight 
    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.

        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day
    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600
    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did
    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer
    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers
    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three
    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the
    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers
    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and
    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the
    journey.  The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius
    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.
    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. 

        Early in the first balloon's flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already
    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with
    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 
    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the
    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the
    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen
    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to 
    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 
    miles) above the surface. 

        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before
    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not
    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of
    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never 
    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature 
    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees 
    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's 
    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background 
    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.

        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and 
    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data
    returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere.  The
    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, 
    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active 
    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.
    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air
    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)
    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.

        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks 
    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.
    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results
    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers 
    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were 
    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 
    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a
    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), 
    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-
    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air 
    over the last seven years.

        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last 
    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on
    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around
    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March
    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the 
    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.
    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial
    bodies with one space vessel.

        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for
    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2
    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking
    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning
    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)
    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still
    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.
    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent 
    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-
    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the ""continent"" of Aphrodite 
    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 
    miles) towards the surface.

        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air 
    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius 
    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1
    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed 
    through the balloon's level.  No positive indications of lightning
    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer 
    failed to function.

        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite
    Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900
    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander's resting place was smoother
    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a
    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in
    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, 
    rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands.  This rock is rich in 
    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree 
    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured 
    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,
    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.

        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at
    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin 
    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 
    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet 
    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers 
    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three 
    hours.

        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley
    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the 
    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-
    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance 
    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets 
    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly 
    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was 
    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  
    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.

        Future Plans Diverted

        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous 
    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second 
    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for
    the early 1990s.

        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple 
    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft 
    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon 
    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's 
    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over 
    the VEGA balloons' two days.  The mission would then head out to 
    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible 
    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main 
    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.

        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in
    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA
    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet
    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space 
    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction 
    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this 
    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next 
    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on
    Mars' largest moon, Phobos. 

        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,
    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and 
    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.
    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious
    consideration of human colonization in the near future.

        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars
    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,
    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other
    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon
    landing in March of 1989. 

        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to
    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the
    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put 
    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have
    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of
    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. 

        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change
    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began 
    to ""open up"" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with 
    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the 
    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking 
    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a ""free market"".

        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.
    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making
    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring
    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to 
    make money.  

        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for 
    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price 
    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary 
    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United 
    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.

        MAGELLAN and GALILEO 

        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration
    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.
    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of
    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most 
    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When
    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be
    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108
    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.

        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space 
    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit 
    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle 
    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, 
    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the 
    probe's primary target's major moons in 1610.

        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on
    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around
    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach
    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary
    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the
    planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in
    that violent atmosphere.

        On the Drawing Boards

        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,
    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-
    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet 
    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, 
    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions 
    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also
    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.

        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects 
    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes
    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected
    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing
    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air
    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed
    to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air
    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.
    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.

        Humans on Venus      

        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?
    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure
    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something
    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into
    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like
    Earth's.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking
    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide 
    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability 
    to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster
    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries
    if not millennia.

        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand
    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how
    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became
    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?
    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found
    through international cooperation, including the nation which 
    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.

Diplomatic :-)

I realize I'm fighting Occam's razor in this argument, so I'll try to
explain why I feel a mind is necessary. 

Firstly, I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They're
great at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not
at working out the method itself.

As a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the
simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do
these with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.
Now, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but
in doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program
them into the computer. You can, of course, 'obfuscate' the trick, and
write the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,
the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does
this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already
pre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that
our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic
material, much of which isn't used.

One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but
(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of 'if you see
object X, then perform action Y,' and we don't seem to get anywhere.
The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what
conclusions to draw from it's experience.

The other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many
algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet
people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are
side-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,
neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -
can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's
code?

The next problem is the sticky question of ""What is colour?"" (replace
'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the
materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of
chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +
different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a
computer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an
algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an
equivalent that doesn't? It shouldn't, because the outputs of each
algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do
we see colour?



A bit of idle speculation...

If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,
with two processes acting on it. The first process has been called
'Unitary Evolution' (or 'U'), is governed by Schroedinger's equation
and is well known. The second process, called various things such as
'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' (or 'R'),
and is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a
'measurement' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely
when that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly
change the wavefunction.

I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something
else,' which I shall imaginitively call 'part X.' It seems reasonable
to assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be
the wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the
wavefunction. Note, though, that we'd need more than U to explain R.)

Anyway, I'm speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to
be some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear
superpositions of anything, although there are alternative
explainations for this. I've no idea how a brain is supposed to access
part X, but since this is only speculation, that won't matter too
much :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in
physics.

I'll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that's OK with you :-)

 X-ray) observations didn't really get started until the '70s.
 I believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in 
 general, and I know that extreme UV (short of 1000 Angstroms)
 observations, until the EUVE (launched last year) had almost 
 no history except a few observations on Skylab in the '70s.

 Twenty-five years ago, the vast majority of astronomers only 
 had access to optical or radio instruments.  Now, with far more
 instruments available, growth in some of these new fields has
 resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of

my statements with ""it is my understanding that..."" Now, I have made
my claim clear with regard to the issue of both the Twelve Imams and 
with Khomeini's supposed claim of infalibility. After hearing your
seemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim
regarding himself, I have withdrawn that portion of my statement
regarding that claim. However, I have received _no_ such response
regarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams. There is nothing
obfuscationist about my claims, which are always made clearly.
 
I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams

Tsiel,

I would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border,
starting from the early 70's.  Certainly the PLO did shell Northern
Israel from the Arqoub region, but Israel did much more shelling
destroying several South Lebanese villages.  At the very least
we can say that both sides exchanged shelling, with occasional
aerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages.
In any case Steve's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in 
response to years of shelling from Lebanon is false.  Israel had
many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government
in Lebanon favorable to Israel, and it nearly achieved this aim
with the election of Basheer El Gemayel, and his brother, Amin
El Gemayel, but the internal situation in Lebanon was too hard
to control and predict so Israel had to withdraw, and Amin El Gemayel
had to abrogate the 17 th of May Agreement.

RTw  12/23 0859  GULF ARABS DEMAND IRAN WITHDRAWAL FROM ISLANDS 

 (Eds: updates with end of summit details, quotes) 
    By Youssef Azmeh 
    ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states, emerging from a summit
that restored 
their unity after almost three months of crisis, piled pressure on Iran
on Wednesday to 
reverse its virtual annexation of a strategic Gulf island. 
    They issued a statement after a three-day Gulf Cooperation Council
summit saying Iran 
had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding
measures that ""rocked 
Gulf stability and security."" 
    The leaders avoided the anti-Iranian rhetoric of recent statements
by Egypt, which 
engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabia
and Qatar that 
allowed all members to attend the summit. 
    Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region and
Tehran's alleged 
encouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind
President Hosni 
Mubarak's mediation. 
    The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between the
Gulf Arab states and 
Iran ""is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take
in line with its 
commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of
the sovreignty and 
territorial integrity of the region's states."" 
    It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it
shares with the 
United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the Greater and
Lesser Tumbs 
islands. 
    Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a
small garrison it 
established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. 
    It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the
island for the 
UAE government. But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority
over the whole 
island, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation. 
    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the
UAE has since the 
Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part
of a general 
settlement. 
    The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against
Iraq for not fully 
implementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. 
    They endorsed once again the ""Damascus Declaration,"" a pact signed
with Egypt and 
Syria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove
Iraqi troops out of 
Kuwait. 
    But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a
fund they 
announced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year
which would have 
helped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme. 
    They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of
contributions from each state 
although the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the
$10 billion agreed 
last year. 
    The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and 
Qatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although
their unity was only 
maintained with outside help. 
    Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow
progress of the 
conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the
region that boasts 
the bulk of global oil and gas reserves. 
    The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals. 
    One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboos
to create a 
100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member
against external 
aggression, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
    Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man
""Peninsula 
Shield"" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is
commanded by a Saudi 
general. 
    Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market
although the summit 
called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due
to be held in 
Saudi Arabia next December.

RTw  12/23 0835  GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT 

    ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-day
annual summit on 
Wednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of three
strategic Gulf islands as 
a condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf. 
    A joint statement issued after the summit, marked by relief over the
settlement of a 
row between two Gulf Cooperation Council members, also called for
continued U.N. sanctions 
against Iraq. 
    It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Council
decisions following the 
expulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year. 
    The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf common
market, but called on 
officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six
members to the next 
summit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993. 
    The statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf
Arab states and Iran 
""is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in
line with its 
commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of
the sovreignty and 
territorial integrity of the region's states."" 
    It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it
shares with the 
United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the smaller
islands, the Greater and 
Lesser Tumbs. 
    It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified
Iranian measures 
which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on
Iran to rescind 
those measures and end the occupation which it said was ""shaking peace
and stability in 
the area."" 
    Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a
small garrison it 
established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. 
    It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the
island for the 
UAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces
continue to 
exercise their authority over the whole island. 
    The UAE has seen this as virtual annexation.

RTw  12/26 1441  IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS 

 (Eds: updates with SNSC statement) 
    NICOSIA, Dec 26, Reuter - Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours on
Saturday it was ready 
to defend militarily three disputed islands, reminding them of its
eight-year war with 
Iraq. 
    ""Our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war) has proved to
the world that 
our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and
safeguard the 
territorial integrity of Iran,"" Iran's Supreme National Security Council
(SNSC) said. 
    A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council
voiced full support 
on Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran
over the Gulf 
islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb. 
    The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings.
Besides the UAE, the GCC 
also groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. 
    Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who chaired the SNSC's
meeting on 
Saturday, said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University:
""Iran is surely 
stronger than the likes of you. To reach these islands one has to cross
a sea of blood."" 
    The SNSC, quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA received
in Cyprus, also 
criticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as ""irresponsible."" 
   ""No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil,""
said the SNSC. 
    Earlier on Saturday, the English language Tehran Times, believed to
be close to the 
Foreign Ministry, said the UAE should be aware that Iran's
self-restraint had certain 
limits. 
    It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971
agreement to 
share Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied. 
    ""The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrain
from responding to 
the blows inflicted by them was ""childish,"" Tehran Times said. 
    IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement which
urged Iran to 
reverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pull
out of the two other 
islands. 
    Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf have
historically belonged to it. 
The dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa.

on pages 51 and on Table I2-B it states there were 2.4 million Armenians in
Turkey from 1844-1856. I guess they ""were simply gone"" after WWI!

[(*] [3] Hovannisian, R. G., ""Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918. 
[(*]                         University of California Press (Berkeley and 
[(*]                         Los Angeles), 1967, pp. 13, 37.

Let's check it out! On page 48 of this Turkish-suggested reference, under
sub-title, ""Deportation and Massacre of Turkish Armenians"" it states:

 ""Several authors assert that Armenian resistance at Van constituted a key
  factor in the Turkish evacuation of Persia and motivated the Ittihadist
  [Young Turk] leaders to annihilate the Turkish Armenians. The question of
  responsibility for the massacres or deportation of nearly all Ottoman
  Armenians has evolved into a polemic. Hundreds of books, articles, and
  documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence
  and death. Many writers, such as the British Bryce and Toynbee, French Pinon,
  German Lepsius, American Morganthau and Gibbons, have insisted that the
  massacres were predetermined and ruthlessly executed. The have refuted the
  Ottoman government's official publications and justifications by
  substantiating that anti-Armenian measures were deliberated by the 
  Ittihadists even before the outbreak of war. The fact remains than an 
  estimated eight hundred thousand to over a million Armenians perished within
  a few months, and several hundred thousand more succumbed in the following
  years to the ravages of disease, famine, and refugee life. Unknown numbers
  of women and children were converted forcibly to Islam, possessed by
  Turkish men, or adopted by Moslem families.""

Stanford Shaw is a paid liar/revisionist for the Turkish government, and has
been exposed as a plagiarizer! For example:

Experts from an interview (in Greek) with Professor Spyros Vryonis (from NYC's
National Herald, 3/12/93) [Thanks, Mr. G.B.]

 ""Few people know of the problem I faced at UCLA when Professor Stanford
  Shaw was due for promotion. I knew him to be Turkey's man; due to my
  reading knowledge of Turkish and my seniority over him, I was a member
  of the promotion committee. For that case, I sat down and read his entire
  treatise ""History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey"". It took me
  three months and I found out, from volume I, that he had plagiarized 
  Uzun Jarsoglu, an eminent Turkish specialist on Ottoman history. Shaw
  himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome 
  of a 20-year search through the Ottoman Archives. Well, I went on leave  
  and managed to show 40% of Volume I, containing around 5000 sentences, 
  to be the result of plagiarism, matching each sentence with passages    
  from the original work. He had even reproduced the errors. So I produced a
  500-pages manuscript and submitted a 60-pages report on Shaw's plagiarism. 

  The University, however, rejected my report and, after a closed meeting,
  promoted Stanford Shaw to Distinguished Professor. I paid a price for 
  all this: upset by the whole process, I confronted the entire University
  structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman. I asked for
  permission to run a seminar on Shaw's book that was denied by the President
  of the University. While the Center for Near Eastern Studies granted me
  permission, the President was depriving me of my academic freedom. Luckily,
  the Dean refused to give in and I did run the seminar, attended by more 
  than 150 academic people, in which I uncovered Stanford Shaw, who refused
  to attend. As a punishment, the University froze all my raises.""

predicitions
if you
have some
many types of
happen again
may predict
reaction

There are several problems here. First, you are discussing only
experimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  The
main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make
prediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could be
the result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activity
occuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations of
the lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that the
observations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science -
it is
*not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted
sense.

Secondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really just
the
requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results.
The
observation of a fossil is 'repeatable', since any qualified observer
may
look at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also,
there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will
correspond
to the current one.  New fossils are found often enough that this is
tested regularly.  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some
conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.

Unfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway been
peripheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (For instance, the
front legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles,
rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).

So, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in the
necessary sense.  Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the
original
event does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations.

[This is not to say that biologists would not go coo-coo if extra-
terrestrial life were discovered - that could make the determination
of the process of abiogenesis relatively easy].

Sounds to me like your dealer really wants to get rid of the IIvx's he has in
stock.  I can imaging that they are getting hard to sell, given that 
 1. a C610 is way faster, and is comparable in price.
 2. an LCIII is about the same speed, and is way cheaper.
So your dealer may well be trying as hard as he can to convince people
that IIvx's are a much better buy than a C610 just so he can get rid of all
his old stock!

Subject: Help Palestinian education


HOW TO HELP PALESTINIAN EDUCATION

(From 'Educational Network', No. 11, April 1993,
publ. by Ramallah Friends Schools, P.O.Box 66, 
Ramallah, West Bank, via Israel
Tel. 972-2-956230,  Fax. 972-2-956231)

Many of our readers have written to us asking how 
individuals and organizations can help Palestinian 
education. We have compiled a list of suggestions to guide 
you. If you are interested in pursuing one or more of 
these suggested activities, the Educational Network can 
aid you by /coordinating/ the initial contacts, /following 
up/, and /providing any other support/ you may need.

1.  Link your teachers' union with a teachers' union here 
--- linkage should be based on a shared pedagogical 
enterprise.

2. Get your union to actively support the right of 
Palestinian teachers in the Occupied Territories to form 
unions:

a. through the International Labor Organization (if your 
union is a member)
b. contacting other international unions which have 
supported our right to form a union -- we can supply 
names and addresses.

3. Establish a SCHOLARSHIP FUND for one or more 
Palestinian students to study at a Palestinian university 
or school -- or establish a scholarship fund for a 
Palestinian student or teacher to study at a university 
abroad.

4. Reproduce and publish information about Palestinian 
education:

    a. for your union membership;
    b. for the outside community.

The Educational Network can supply up-to-date 
information and statistics.

5. Send delegations of teachers to visit the Occupied 
Territories during periods when our schools are in 
session.

The Network can arrange an itinerary, make hotel and 
local travel arrangements, and provide a guide for the 
visit.

6. Sponsor Palestinian teachers to visit your city for an 
educational tour:

      a. to see schools and speak with educators in order to
          learn about progressive pedagogical ideas and
           experiences;

      b. to speak about the conditions of Palestinian
          education.

The Network will coordinate from Palestine.

7. Establish teacher-exchange programs for one year in 
which a Palestinian teacher from a private school teaches 
at a public or private school abroad while a teacher from 
that school spends a year in a Palestinian private school.

8. Send an experienced educator to the Occupied 
Territories to give workshops (all-day workshops or two-
day workshops) on innovative teaching techniques.

The Network will pay for the person's food, lodging, and 
travel while in Palestine, and will serve as guide.

9. Set up a pen-pal program with a Palestinian school in 
either English or French.

10. Set up a sister-school program with a Palestinian 
school which would actively involve teachers as well as 
students at both schools -- a great tool for building 
international understanding and mutual sensitivity.

11. Keep the Educational Network informed about 
important educational conferences so that we can send a 
Palestinian teacher to attend.

12. Send to the Educational Network articles or other 
writings or books dealing with innovative approaches and 
ideas in the field of education so that we can then 
disseminate the information locally.",4

But it's STILL HAPPENING.  That's the entire point.  Only last month, John
Major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of
arms to Saudi Arabia.  The same month, we sold jet fighters to the same
Indonesian government that's busy killing the East Timorese.

It's all very well to say ""Oops, we made a boo-boo, better clean up the
mistake"", but the US and UK *keep* making the *same* mistake.  They do it so
often that I can't believe it's not deliberate.  This suspicion is reinforced
by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a decrepit
economy reliant on arms sales.

the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time

you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time (instead of just

   would have risked themselves if only Jews were persecuted and
   Hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (I am no student of history
   and I am just asking questions.)

I don't think they would have.  After all the U.S. was one of the
countries that turned away Jewish refugees when there was still time
to get them out.  (Considered and rejected at the Cabinet level then..)

   ...
   Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries,
   is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious
   accusations of religious bigotry and such.

As I understand it, International law provides the right of any
country to intervene to prevent genocide.  I think once the World
Court has ruled that genocide is being committed... 

If a Human Rights Czar is appointed at the U.N., we could have
international monitors recording events and responses of local
officials and develop an objective basis.  This could be backed by
adjudication at the International Court of Justice and enforcement
through a Rapid Deployment Force under the U.N. Secretary General's
command.  I would like to see the U.N.  directly impose ICJ rulings
whenever feasible (without the possibility of vetos at the UN Security
Council.. much as the President can't veto a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling). 
 
The U.S. is now supporting the effort to appoint the HR Czar -- the
third world opposition is led by three countries, China, Iran and
Pakistan (What company is Pakistan keeping!).  

The U.S. is also reconsidering its opposition to the U.N. force
initially envisaged in the Charter (although under the control of the
Security Council).  The UN SC is quite a flawed body.  Rogue
governments like the PRC have even threatened their veto in the last
few months to block the move to place U.N. troops in Bosnia under
Chapter 7 instead of 11 (if I have the numbers straight) where they
could have moved from being a monitoring to an enforcement force
without requiring further SC action.  (The PRC even continues to
threaten using its veto on U.N. action despite the ICJ ruling.  The
current set-up requires the SC to enforce ICJ rulings..).

No wonder you clown are in such a mess. Let's take Sarkis Atamian's (an 
Armenian Dashnak sociolog) book, ""The Armenian Community"", pages 97 and 
105. Atamian quotes:

 ""... the immediate question concerned itself with the organization and
 tactics of revolution. The liberation of Armenia, the immediate aim of
 the Party, was to be attained by:

      1. Oral and written propaganda.
      2. Terrorism - both as punishment against the enemy and as a measure
         of self defense. 
      3. The creation of an avant-garde of revolutionary groups to be
         equipped and prepared for action when other nations were prepared
         for a general uprising.
      4. The organization of larger committees to be in constant contact with
         each other and subject to a central body.
      5. Organization of units of guerilla fighters.""

Now, on page 105, Atamian's book quotes of Armenian constitution:

 ""... If the means was revolution, how was the revolution to be attained?
 By:

      1. Propaganda 
      2. Preparation of combat units and their indoctrination
      3. Encouragement of the revolutionary morale of the people
      4. The arming of the people
      5. Organization of revolutionary committees
      6. Espionage throughout the country and the exchange of information with
         the official bodies and journals
      7. Organization of financial zones for public collection 
      8. 'Fighting and using' the weapon of the terror on corrupt government
         officers, spies, traitors, grafters, and all sorts of oppressors
      9. Defense of the people against attacks from the brigandry
     10. Building of roads for the transport of arms
     11. Wrecking and looting of governmental institutions.""

Many of the recent Armenian terrorist acts against the Turkish people 
were committed by the brainwashed members of the ""Tzeghagron"", namely, 
""race-worshipers"" of the Dashnag Youth Organization. Ironically, again, 
Tzeghagron was set up by an undisputed Armenian Nazi, Karekin Nejdeh,
in 1941 (see Atamian, loc cit, page 389).

Muslims helping the Nazis???  Where on earth do you come up with such
accuusation??  Do you have proofs??  If not, you should publically apologize
for such a statement.  Last time I heard, the nazis prided themselves in
needing no body to carry their politics and ideologies.  And if your statment
were true, don't you think Israel would of used it to point to what a Muslim
neighbor (PALESTINE) could do to them if they allowed it to be?  The jewish
lobby and power is very strong, and if what you said is true, we would of
heard it from them before you could come up with it.
And you dare say that you are taking no sides!!",4

I think this should be illuminating to all. Let me make a first
suggestion. When Arabic words, especially technical ones, become of use 
let us define them for those, especially atheists, to whom they may not be
terribly familiar. Please also note that though I did initially refer
to Khomeini as a heretic for what I understood to be a claim -- rejected 
by you since -- of personal infallibility, I withdraw this as a basis
for such a statement. I conditionally retain this reference in regard
to Khomeini's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the 
so-called ""Twelve Imams,"" which is in clear conflict with the Qur'an 
in that it places the Twelve Imams in a category of behavior and example
higher than that of the Muhammad, in that the Qur'an shows that the
Prophet was clearly fallible, as well as (it appears, given your
abstruse theological statment regarding the ""natures""  of the Twelve
Imams) placing them in a different metaphysical category than the 
remainder of humanity, with the possible exception of Muhammad, 
something which verges on the sin of association.

I read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my name
on the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really
offensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or
publisher), and read it, ""cover to cover"" (to use a phrase that seems
popular here right now).

And I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but
it was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie
grew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in
New Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the
strange constructions of Indian English: the ""yaar"" at the end of a
sentence, ""Butbutbut,"" the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)

At the time I still ""sorta-kinda"" thought of myself as a muslim, and I
couldn't see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this
was allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who
took on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives, and had not (as my
grandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes; in
short, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to
have missed the point completely.  (And I won't mention the fact that the
most militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)

Perhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it
exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity
need an agent? She can come directly to me, can't she? How do we know that
Muhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how
do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up, or
put in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four
women, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest
insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to
suppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some ""holy"" guy. Not to
mention murder the author.)


I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really
silly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read ""Mein
Kampf?"" It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why don't they
just read the book and decide for themselves?

Maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book, and the absence of
protest from the ""liberal"" muslims to Khomeini's fatwa outrage, was the
final push I needed into atheism!

Is the Performa 400 about the same as an lc and if so would the homemade

"Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ...
  
   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried
out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some
time.  A good reference on this might be: ""Comparison of Propulsion
Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-
0639)."" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper
describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve
aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems
associated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speed
airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane
   The design (the concept is also called ""Beta"") as laid out in the
paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000
pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and
life support.  System design reliability is .9995.
   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets
and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-
long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-
stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy
payload on an expendable second stage.
   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a
normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,
modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,
would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing
out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like
aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.
   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff
is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.
The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs
of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust
rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,
with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-
25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would
be stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's
success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact
tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.
     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude
while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,
cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater
safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle
and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude ""In conjunction with its major
use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-
ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide
as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical
configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can
be shown to be operationally viable.""
  
   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for
some time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL
SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-
examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.
   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going
studies trying straighten out the government's future space
transportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)
are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are
various factions and options vying for attention -- including
shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the ""4-2-3""
architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced
vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,
etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy
for future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to
juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against
medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against
the investment and risk of going to ""leap frog"" new technologies
like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.
   It's a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn't
that there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens
of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in
the near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a
final report coming by the end of the fiscal year.

"It seems that Egypt is only interested in fighting wars against its own
people, while objecting to any steps for Bosnia.. I am not surprised,

all the criminals of Egypt)

Thanks Saudia for the pocket change.
Compare that to the ""Liberation of Q8"" and to what they gave to some
weird causes.. O.K at least they are paying.


Mr. Amr Moussa was not worried about International law when he tortured
to death  many of his citizens and when he shot people praying in a Mosque,
or when he is causing trouble to his neighbor just becasue the CIA says so.
Why doesn't he just shut up, he won't be involved in any Bosnian effort
anyway, or does the west have to be represented even in an Islamic conference?

The more I hear about the Egyptian regime, the more I understand the
existence of the ""Jamaa Islamiyah"" there. After all most of its members
and leaders are former and current victims of government torture, injustice,
or relatives of victims. In some other places they get psychiatric care AND
revenge in the COURTS. But all they got is more of the same resulting  in a 
cycle of madness that is initiated by the government with the illicit support 
of the west who is more concerned about the safety of half naked tourists in
conservative neighborhoods than the dignity, social justice, and safety of the
majority of the poor oppressed people of Egypt. Enough said.",4
"From article <1993Apr22.165659.8890@desire.wright.edu>, by demon@desire.wright.edu (Not a Boomer):

Hmmm... that's not quite right.  The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close
to the IIvx (but a better buy IMO).  I also don't think they are so
much a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution.
Why else bundle at ease (among other things)?  Hardly a business
application. 

What do you mean by 'no ""retail price""'.  Quite the contrary, I think.
The price is darn near the same all across the country.  That (again,
IMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling
required.  Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set.  One
price, medium performance, ready to go.

When I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears
(*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and
Bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  Why I chose one over the
other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who
went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who
sells Apples?).  Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I
suspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know
didly about the computers, peecee or mac.  But then, neither did any
of the  Apple dealers I spoke with...

If you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from
Montgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time.  Go figure.
I'm *real* happy with my Performa.  Oh, and I bought the Apple
Performa Plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party).  Happy with that
decision as well.  I walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out
with a spankin' new computer the day before Christmas.

there (I just checked on 04/28/93 at 9:35 CDT), and you can ""get"" them
(don't forget the ""binary"" mode!), but you can't ""ls"" in the
""/incoming"" directory.

A further update: Mark's design made the cover of Space News this week
as one of the design alternatives which was rejected.  But he's still
in there plugging.  I wish him luck -- using ET's as the basis of a
Space Station has been a good idea for a long time.

May the best design win.

Reboost may not be a problem, if they have enough fuel.  If they don't do a 
reboost this time, they will definitely have to do one on the next servicing
mission.  But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
back and you could have problems.  The shuttle just isn't designed to land 
with that much weight in the payload.


of course that is a concern too, and the loss of science during the time
that it is on the ground.  plus a fear that if it comes down, some
big-wig might not allow it to go back up.  but the main concern, I
believe is the danger of the landing.  Just to add another bad vibe,
they also increase the risk of damaging an instrument.  Finally, 
this is a chance for NASA astronanuts to prove they could build and
service a space station.  Hubble was designed for in flight servicing.

bringing the telescope down, to my understanding, was considered
even very recently, but all these factors contribute to the 
decision to do it the way it was planned in the beginning.

No, the sky does not, at this time, belong to anyone.  Ownership is necessary
to the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the
action was good or bad.  If neither you or I own a brick wall, then I can't
unilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right, and you don't
have the authority to declare that it is wrong.  The owner may find it artistic
or she may be call the police.

(this applies to the argument on bright satellites more than street lights)

It's vandalism because many people -- power companies -- do maliciously waste light. 

""maliciously"" implies evil intent.  The lighting companies aren't going out
of their way to spoil the sky.  They just don't care.


It is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware.
If that's what your city will buy, that's what the lighting company will sell.

That is, I think that space advertising is an interesting idea, and if someone

the cost of launch is not the only cost of advertising, and a company who 
gauged that ill will would lose them more revenue than the advertising would
gain might decide to bow out of the project.

For the time to watch, tel. 0891-88-19-50 (48p/min peak 36p/min all other
times, but prediction is at start of the weekly message so it only costs a
few pence).

E-mail reports of sightings would be appreciated: give lat/long and UT (a
few seconds accuracy if possible) when it passes ABOVE or BELOW any bright
star (say brighter than mag. 3), planet or Moon.

With Moon in evening sky also, note that from somewhere in U.K. Mir will
pass in front of the Moon each night! Please alert local clubs to the
telephone newsline, and general public as Mir can cause quite a stir!

";    I am a serious motorcycle enthusiast without a motorcycle, and to
;put it bluntly, it sucks.  I really would like some advice on what would
;be a good starter bike for me.  I do know one thing however, I need to
;make my first bike a good one, because buying a second any time soon is
;out of the question.  I am specifically interested in racing bikes, (CBR
;600 F2, GSX-R 750).  I know that this may sound kind of crazy
;considering that I've never had a bike before, but I am responsible, a
;fast learner, and in love.  

Responsible and in love?  I believe that's a contradiction
in terms.

Unless you're really brave (read: ""reckless"") a 500cc sport
bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first
year of riding.  Getting more than that really is overkill,
as you'll never even want to use it.  The following bikes
can be bought (and repaired!) cheaply, are easy for a novice
to manage, and are plenty high performance:
    Kawasaki EX-500
    Honda VF-500 ""Interceptor""
    Suzuki GS-550E

The 0-100mph time of the EX-500 at full throttle is ""way
sooner than you're ready for it"".  :-)  With something
as small as a 250, you'd probably be wishing for more
power pretty quickly (unless it's a TZR or RGV :).

Now, I'm not saying that you're 100% certain to kill
yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a GSXR-750.  Plenty
of people have started riding on those bikes and done
just fine.  What I am saying is that it's a waste of
money, and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you
drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping.
You'll never get the throttle more than half open
anyway, so why spend the extra 2000 bucks?

                                   Overview

Welcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the
newsgroups.

Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often
come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post
them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has
been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the
alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following
titles:

   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers
   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism
   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument
   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources

This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The
others are entirely optional.

If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup
news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled ""A Primer on How to Work With
the Usenet Community"", ""Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet""
and ""Hints on writing style for Usenet"" are particularly relevant.  Questions
concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.

If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the ""Finding
Stuff"" section below.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them
to anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the
author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it
does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating
around the network.


                                Finding Stuff

All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are
some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:

1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with
   ""Alt.Atheism FAQ:"".

2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.

   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up
   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the
   problem.

3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226].
   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest
   versions of the FAQ files there.

   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you
   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to
   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with

      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq

   in the body.

4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article
   ""Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup"" carries a list of these
   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.

5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
   consisting of the following lines:

      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources
      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq
      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction
      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic
      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources

5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of
   the following lines:

      send atheism/faq/faq.txt
      send atheism/faq/logic.txt
      send atheism/faq/intro.txt
      send atheism/faq/resource.txt

   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.
   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are ""help"" and
   ""send atheism/index"".

6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the
   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this
   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to
   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.
   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,
   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have 
   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.

"Hi,

I have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this
LCIII PDS Ethernet adapter with an optional 68882 socket on the board.
My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 68882
on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? Intuitively,
the math co-processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but
I am not sure how good Apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when
it comes to throughout. Does anyone know the answer to this or have
any experience with the Asante LCIII Ethernet adapter? Thanks in advance.

I would have to say that the ""greatest philosopher"" title would have to
go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially
defined by him.  Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did 
definitively identify what the important questions are.  I think it
was Descartes who said that ""All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato.""

If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances
in human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle.
This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as ""the philosopher"".

Regarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since his
ideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful
that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years
from now.  They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.

As for ""modern"" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the most
influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who
came after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and 
amplified them over time).

I would say that the most influential ""american"" philosopher would have to
be Dewey.

But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in
500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect
was ""American"", but was born in Russia).  But I guess that remains to be seen.",3
"
Mr. Oguocha,
  ""Muslims"" in the Bosnian context are in fact ""Turks""... In fact, correct
  me if I am wrong, Serbs are attacking Bosnians with their battle cries
  ""Death to the Turks!"". 

  Is this so shocking? Years of communism apparently suppressed their 
  hatred and anger towards the Turks. But such hatred is obviously one that
  dies hard. 
  
  Serbs must understand, Turks are no longer the good old barbarians world
  has come to know by propaganda after propaganda. 
  
  Serbs must further understand that barbarism does not work. 
  
  Serbs must even further understand that barbarism would one day have
  to face counter-barbarism. So, I urge those people [Serbs] to stop
  killing Bosnian women and children. And they must never forget that
  Turks in the motherland are watching...patiently.

   It is indeed different usage of the word Muslim . In Bosnia , it is more or

HST is about 25,500 lbs (11,600 kg).  That doesn't include the cradle that
would have been in the cargo bay when it was deployed.  Spacelab-J on STS-47
was 21,861 lbs (according to the press-kit). 

As someone else pointed out if they had been unable to deploy it for some
reason that would have had to land with it still in the cargo bay and this
was a planned for contingency.  This is not a problem for the shuttle,
though it would eliminate KSC as a landing site, they still have to go to
Edwards when landing with something like Spacelab in the cargo bay.

we need the code for decompression of Quicktime JPEG Pict files, as they

The code should be in C Pascal or Modula. The code will be used on several

put around it (much less then a mac! perhaps only a DSP with some support

If the code is not available, perhaps the algorithm is available to

"Getting wierd again?

Okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to Pluto is to large and to
expensive..

Okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts.. Kind of liek the old
MIRV principle of old Cold War Days. 
Basically what I mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for
different missions,namely different planets. Each probe would be tied in with
the mother ship (or earth as the case may be).. This is good when and if we go
for Mars (the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for the
probes.

Also the mother ship would be powered (if not the Mars Mission) by a normal
propulsion, but also a solar sail (main reason for solar sail race is to see
what can be done and autmoated?) the sail would get the probes to were they
needed.. I know the asteroid/meteor clouds (and such) might get in the way of a 
Sail??

Main reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send
multiple probes/mission/satellites/exploreres to different places and cut
costs..
The probes could do fly bys or ?? we shall see...",3

""The atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time
 against the Muslim population within the Armenian Republic have been 
 confirmed with very accurate information, and the observations made by
 Rawlinson, the British representative in Erzurum, have confirmed that
 these atrocities are being committed by the Armenians. The United States
 delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came 
 to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers, hungry and miserable, 
 their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation
 was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed
 by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns
 before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people. When it was hoped
 that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of 
 February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region
 of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According
 to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the
 aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered,
 many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women
 have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who
 were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the
 mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity 
 and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the
 Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order 
 to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities 
 committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims
 be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives,
 and honour of the Muslims be protected.""

Actually, a WERA racer, William Lumsden, considered running a Vmax in 
A Superstock.  He took it out to Talladega GPR for a practice day, and
_really_ annoyed the 600 riders -- they usually got caught behind a 
sideways Vmax in the corners, and if they passed him going in, he'd
blow by down the straight (usually wobbling).  Needless to say, since
he was 2 seconds faster on a 1977 CB400F, he decided against the Vmax.

"Mike Adams suggested discussions on long-term effects of spaceflight
to the human being.  I love this topic, as some of you regulars know.

So, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk
about it; I shall.

I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources
to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate
on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent 
as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and 
probably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands
the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence
of such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.

I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only
communicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.

A well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science
variables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long
expenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational
to the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to 
compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical
journals which would address each major life science area.  In addition,
ideas for further research and development could be put forward for
the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take
part in the excitement of exploration.

Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week
to running literature searches and finding journal articles.  In addition,
we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls
of NASA and industry.

I have appreciated the positive responses to date and I am personally
eager to start this project.  Perhaps we could start with debate regarding
how best to grade the viability of various technologies for application
to spaceflight.",3

I'm afraid I don't know arabic; I have only read translations. I wouldn't

writing has been done under the influence of, shall we say, consciousness
altering substances.

should have done something about it.)


I haven't interviewed all muslims about this; I would really like it if this
were false. But I can't take it on your say-so - what are your sources?


What other basis do we have to judge a system? Especially when we can't get
a consistent picture of what Islam ""really"" is. Do I believe Khomeini? Do I
go by the Imam of the mosque in Mecca? Or perhaps the guy in New Jersey? Or
perhaps you say I should go only by the Quran. Ok, whose translation? And
what about things like ""And wherever you find idolators, kill them""?

No, the thing is designed to be retrievable, in a pinch.  Indeed, this
dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays, since they had to be
retractable as well as extendable, and may thus have indirectly contributed
to the array-flapping problems.

The retrieval problems are exactly as stated:  it would be costly, would
involve extensive downtime (and the worry of someone finding a reason not
to re-launch it), and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot
of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination.",3
