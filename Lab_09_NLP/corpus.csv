Bob_Dylan,"I ain't lookin' to compete with you Beat or cheat or mistreat you Simplify you, classify you Deny, defy or crucify you All I really want to do Is, baby, be friends with you No, and I ain't lookin' to fight with you Frighten you or uptighten you Drag you down or drain you down Chain you down or bring you down All I really want to do Is, baby, be friends with you I ain't lookin' to block you up Shock or knock or lock you up Analyze you, categorize you Finalize you or advertise you All I really want to do Is, baby, be friends with you I don't want to straight-face you Race or chase you, track or trace you Or disgrace you or displace you Or define you or confine you All I really want to do Is, baby, be friends with you I don't want to meet your kin Make you spin or do you in Or select you or dissect you Or inspect you or reject you All I really want to do Is, baby, be friends with you I don't want to fake you out Take or shake or forsake you out I ain't lookin' for you to feel like me See like me or be like me All I really want to do Is, baby, be friends with you  I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn I courted her proudly but now she is gone Gone as the season she's taken In a young summer's youth, I stole her away From her mother and sister, though close did they stay Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day With strings of guilt, they tried hard to guide us Of the two sisters, I loved the young With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one The constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone By the jealousy of others around her For her parasite sister, I had no respect Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect Countless visions of the other she'd reflect As a crutch for her scenes and her society Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused The changes I was going through can't even be used For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped Noticing not that I'd already slipped To a sin of love's false security From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace Answers of emptiness voice vacancies Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, ""Please- What's wrong, what's exactly the matter?"" And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream At the peak of the night, the king and the queen Tumbled all down into pieces ""The tragic figure,"" her sister did shout. ""Leave her alone, goddamn you, get out."" And I in my armor, turning about And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness Beneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound Her sister and I in a screaming battleground And she in between, the victim of sound Soon shattered as a child to the shadows All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night Leaving all of love's ashes behind me The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet I think of her often and hope whoever she's met Will be fully aware of how precious she is Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me ""How good, how good does it feel to be free?"" And I answer them most mysteriously ""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""  I woke in the mornin' wandering, weary and worn out I woke in the mornin' wandering, weary and worn out Wishin' my long-lost lover would walk to me and talk to me Tell me what it's all about I was standin' at the side road, listenin' to the billboard knock Standin' at the side road, listenin' to the billboard knock Well, my wrist was empty but my nerves were kickin' Tickin' like a clock If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime Anytime you want Sometimes I'm thinkin' I'm too high to fall Sometimes I'm thinkin' I'm much too high to fall Other times I'm thinkin' I'm so low I don't know If I can come up at all Black crows in the meadow, sleepin' across the broad highway Black crows in the meadow across the broad highway Though it's funny, honey, I'm out of touch Don't feel much like a scarecrow today  Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll We ducked inside a doorway as thunder went crashing As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight And for each and every underdog soldier in the night And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched With faces hidden as the walls were tightening As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain Dissolved into the bells of the lightning Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder As the clanging of the church bells blew far into the breeze Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin' In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales For the disrobed faceless forms of no position Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts All down in taken-for-granted situations Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting Electric light still struck like arrows fired but for the ones Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin' Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look Spellbound and swallowed 'til the tolling ended Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'  I can't understand, she let go of my hand And left me here facing the wall I'd sure like to know why she did go But I can't get close to her at all Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime She said she would never forget But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here She acts like we never met It's all new to me, like some mystery It could even be like a myth But it's hard to think on that she's the same one That last night I was with From darkness, dreams are deserted Am I still dreamin' yet? I wish she'd unlock her voice once and talk 'Stead of acting like we never met If she ain't feelin' well, then why don't she tell 'Stead of turnin' her back to my face? Without any doubt she seems too far out For me to return to or chase Though her skirt it swayed as the guitar played Her mouth was watery and wet But now something has changed, for she ain't the same She just acts like we never have met If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess To anything I might have tried If I was with her too long or I've done something wrong I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide Though the night ran swirling and whirling I remember her whispering yet But evidently she don't, evidently she won't She just acts like we never have met I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way Of this I can't say very much But if you want me to, I can be just like you And pretend that we never have touched And if anybody asks me, ""Is it easy to forget?"" I'll say, ""It's easily done You just pick anyone And pretend that you never have met""  I can't understand, she let go of my hand And left me here facing the wall I'd sure like to know why she did go But I can't get close to her at all Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime She said she would never forget But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here She acts like we never met It's all new to me, like some mystery It could even be like a myth But it's hard to think on that she's the same one That last night I was with From darkness, dreams are deserted Am I still dreamin' yet? I wish she'd unlock her voice once and talk 'Stead of acting like we never met If she ain't feelin' well, then why don't she tell 'Stead of turnin' her back to my face? Without any doubt she seems too far out For me to return to or chase Though her skirt it swayed as the guitar played Her mouth was watery and wet But now something has changed, for she ain't the same She just acts like we never have met If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess To anything I might have tried If I was with her too long or I've done something wrong I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide Though the night ran swirling and whirling I remember her whispering yet But evidently she don't, evidently she won't She just acts like we never have met I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way Of this I can't say very much But if you want me to, I can be just like you And pretend that we never have touched And if anybody asks me, ""Is it easy to forget?"" I'll say, ""It's easily done You just pick anyone And pretend that you never have met""  Now I'm just average, common too I'm just like him, the same as you I'm everybody's brother and son I ain't different than anyone Ain't no use to talk to me It's just the same as talking to you I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay I said ""Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come 26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you better run 99,100 101,102, your ma won't even recognize you 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen Well, I don't know, but I've been told The streets of heaven are lined with gold I ask you how things could get much worse If the Russians happen to get up there first Wowee! Pretty scary! Now I'm liberal, but to a degree I want everybody to be free But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater Move in next door and marry my daughter You must think I'm crazy! I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba Well, I set my monkey on the log And ordered him to do the Dog He wagged his tail and shook his head And he went and did the Cat instead He's a weird monkey! Very funky! I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist And my wig-hat was falling in my face But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court I gotta woman, she's so mean She sticks my boots in the washing machine Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude Puts bubblegum in my food She's funny Wants my money Calls me honey Now I got a friend who spends his life Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife Dreams of stranglin' me with a scarf When my name comes up he pretends to barf I've got a million friends! Now they asked me to read a poem At the sorority sister's home I got knocked down and my head was swimmin' I wound up with the Dean of Women Yippee! I'm a poet, I know it Hope I don't blow it I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange So I look like a walking mountain range And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse Out to the country club and the golf course Carryin' the New York Times Shoot a few holes, blow their minds Well, you're probably wondering by now Just what this song is all about What's probably got you baffled more Is what this thing here is for It's nothin' It's something I learned over in England  Go away from my window Leave at your own chosen speed I'm not the one you want, babe I'm not the one you need You say you're lookin' for someone Who's never weak, but always strong To protect you and defend you Whether you are right or wrong Someone to open each and every door But it ain't me, babe No, no, no, it ain't me, babe It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe Go lightly from the ledge, babe Go lightly on the ground I'm not the one you want, babe I'll only let you down You say you're lookin' for someone Who'll promise never to part Someone to close his eyes to you Someone to close his heart Someone who will die for you and more But it ain't me, babe No, no, no, it ain't me, babe It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe Go melt back in the night Everything inside is made of stone There's nothing in here moving And anyway, I'm not alone You say you're lookin' for someone Who'll pick you up each time you fall To gather flowers constantly And to come each time you call A lover for your life and nothing more But it ain't me, babe No, no, no, it ain't me, babe It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe But it ain't me, babe No, no, no, it ain't me, babe It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe  Go away from my window Leave at your own chosen speed I'm not the one you want, babe I'm not the one you need You say you're lookin' for someone Who's never weak, but always strong To protect you and defend you Whether you are right or wrong Someone to open each and every door But it ain't me, babe No, no, no, it ain't me, babe It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe Go lightly from the ledge, babe Go lightly on the ground I'm not the one you want, babe I'll only let you down You say you're lookin' for someone Who'll promise never to part Someone to close his eyes to you Someone to close his heart Someone who will die for you and more But it ain't me, babe No, no, no, it ain't me, babe It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe Go melt back in the night Everything inside is made of stone There's nothing in here moving And anyway, I'm not alone You say you're lookin' for someone Who'll pick you up each time you fall To gather flowers constantly And to come each time you call A lover for your life and nothing more But it ain't me, babe No, no, no, it ain't me, babe It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe But it ain't me, babe No, no, no, it ain't me, babe It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe  I pounded on a farmhouse  Lookin' for a place to stay I was mighty, mighty tired I had come a long, long way I said ""Hey hey in there Is there anybody home?"" I was standin' on the steps Feelin' most alone When out comes a farmer He must have thought that I was nuts He immediately looked at me And stuck a gun into my guts I fell down to My bended knees Saying ""I dig farmers Don't shoot me, please"" He cocked his rifle And began to shout ""Are you that travelin' salesman That I have heard about?"" I said ""No, no, no I'm a doctor and it's true I'm a clean-cut kid And I been to college too"" Then in comes his daughter Whose name was Rita She looked like she stepped Out of La Dolce Vita I immediately tried to cool it With her dad And told him what a nice Pretty farm he had He said ""What do doctors know About farms, pray tell?"" I said ""I was born at the bottom Of a wishing well"" Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie He said ""I guess you're tired"" He said it kind of sly I said ""Yes, ten thousand miles Today I drove"" He said ""I got a bed for you Underneath the stove Just one condition You can go to sleep right now That you don't touch my daughter And in the morning, milk the cows"" I was sleepin' like a rat When I heard something jerkin' There stood Rita Lookin' just like Tony Perkins She said ""Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door"" I said ""Oh, no, no I've been through this movie before"" I knew I had to split But I did not know how When she said ""Would you like to take that shower now?"" Well, I couldn't leave Unless the old man chased me out 'Cause I'd already promised That I'd milk his cows I had to say something To strike him very weird So I yelled ""I like Fidel Castro and his beard"" Rita looked offended But she got out of the way As he came charging down the stairs Sayin' ""What's that I heard you say?"" I said, ""I like Fidel Castro I think you heard me right"" And I ducked as he swung At me with all his might Rita mumbled something 'Bout her mother on the hill As his fist, it hit the icebox He said he's going to kill Me if I don't get out the door In two seconds flat ""You unpatriotic Rotten doctor Commie rat"" Well, he threw a Reader's Digest At my head and I did run I did a somersault As I seen him get his gun And crashed through the window At a hundred miles an hour And landed fully blast In his garden flowers Rita said ""Come back"" And he started to load The sun was comin' up And I was runnin' down the road Well, I don't figure I'll be back There for a spell Even though Rita moved away And got a job at a motel He still waits for me Constant on the sly He wants to turn me in To the F.B.I. Me, I romp and stompings Thankful as I romp Without freedom of speech I might be in the swamp  Crimson flames tied through my ears Rollin' high and mighty traps Pounced with fire on flaming roads Using ideas as my maps ""We'll meet on edges soon,"" said I Proud 'neath heated brow Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth ""Rip down all hate,"" I screamed Lies that life is black and white Spoke from my skull, I dreamed Romantic facts of musketeers Foundationed deep somehow Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now Girls' faces formed the forward path From phony jealousy To memorizing politics Of ancient history Flung down by corpse evangelists Unthought of, though, somehow Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now A self-ordained professor's tongue Too serious to fool Spouted out that liberty Is just equality in school ""Equality,"" I spoke the word As if a wedding vow Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand At the mongrel dogs who teach Fearing not I'd become my enemy In the instant that I preach My existence led by confusion boats Mutiny from stern to bow Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats Too noble to neglect Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect Good and bad, I'd define these terms Quite clear, no doubt, somehow Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now  Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem Cannot hold you to its heat Your temperature is too hot for taming Your flaming feet are burning up the street I am homeless, come and take me To reach of your rattling drums Let me know, babe, all about my fortune Down along my restless palms Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed I have fallen far beneath Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing And your flashing diamond teeth The night is pitch black, come and make my Pale face fit into place, oh, please Let me know, babe, I'm nearly drowning If it's you my lifelines trace I've been wondering all about me Ever since I seen you there On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding I know I'm 'round you but I don't know where You have slayed me, you have made me I got to laugh half-ways off my heels I got to know, babe, will you surround me So I can know if I am really real?  Ramona, come closer, shut softly your watery eyes The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise For the flowers of the city, though breathlike, get deathlike sometimes And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines Your cracked country lips, I still wish to kiss, as to be by the strength of your skin Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feelin' like this I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to to the south You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose From fixtures and forces and friends, your sorrow does stem That hype you and type you, making you feel that you gotta be just like them I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words would turn into a meaningless ring For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring Everything passes, everything changes, just do what you think you should do And someday, maybe, who knows, baby, I'll come and be crying to you  When she said, ""Don't waste your words, they're just lies,"" I cried she was deaf And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes, and said, ""What else you got left?"" It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, ""Don't forget Everybody must give something back for something they get"" I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come And she buttoned her boot, and straightened her suit, and she said, ""Don't get cute"" So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked And after finding out I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against Her Jamaica rum, and when she did come, I asked her for some She said, ""No, dear,"" I said, ""Your words aren't clear, you'd better spit out your gum"" She screamed 'til her face got so red, then she fell on the floor And I covered up and then thought I'd go look through her drawer And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you And you, you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time And I, I never took much, I never asked for your crutch Now don't ask for mine  Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it Sometimes it gets so hard, you see I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet With all these promises you left for me But where are you tonight, Sweet Marie? Well, I waited for you when I was a-half sick Yes, I waited for you when you hated me Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic When you knew I had some other place to be Now, where are you tonight, Sweet Marie? Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately Well, six white horses that you did promise Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary But to live outside the law, you must be honest I know you always say that you agree Alright, so where are you tonight, Sweet Marie? Well, I don't know how it happened But the river-boat captain, he knows my fate But everybody else, even yourself They're just gonna have to wait Well, I got the fever down in my pockets The Persian drunkard, he follows me Yes, I can take him to your house but I can't unlock it You see, you forgot to leave me with the key Ah, where are you tonight, Sweet Marie? Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed That a man can't give his address out to bad company And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad In the ruins of your balcony Wondering where you are tonight, Sweet Marie  The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ grinder cries The silver saxophones say I should refuse you The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you I want you I want you I want you so bad Honey, I want you The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup And ask me to open up the gate for you I want you I want you Yes, I want you so bad Honey, I want you Now all my fathers, they've gone down True love, they've been without it And all their daughters put me down 'Cause I don't think about it Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter I want you I want you Yes, I want you so bad Honey, I want you Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute No, I wasn't that cute to him, was I? But I did it because he lied and because he took you for a ride And because time was on his side and because I Want you I want you Yes, I want you so bad Honey, I want you  Nobody feels any pain Tonight as I stand inside the rain Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes But lately I see her ribbons and her bows Have fallen from her curls She takes just like a woman Yes, she does, she makes love just like a woman Yes, she does, and she aches just like a woman But she breaks just like a little girl Queen Mary, she's my friend Yes, I believe I'll go see her again Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed 'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest With her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls She takes just like a woman Yes, she makes love just like a woman Yes, she does, and she aches just like a woman But she breaks just like a little girl It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst So I came in here And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse Is this pain in here, I can't stay in here, ain't it clear That I just can't fit Yes, I believe that it's time for us to quit But when we meet again, introduced as friends Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world Ah, you fake just like a woman Yes, you do, you make love just like a woman Yes, you do, then you ache just like a woman But you break just like a little girl  Well, I see you got your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat Yes, I see you got your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under somethin' like that Under your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat Well, you look so pretty in it, honey, can I jump on it sometime?

leopard-skin pill-box hat Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you, it's bad for your health, he said Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead You know, I don't

love with him, you forgot to close the garage door You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for It's your brand new, leopard-skin pill-box hat  You say you love

sooner or later, one of us must know That you just did what you're supposed to do Sooner or later, one of us must know That I really did try to get close to you I couldn't see when it started snowin' Your voice was all that I heard I couldn't see where we were goin' But you said you knew and I took your word And then you told me later as I apologized That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm And I told you as you clawed out my eyes That I never really meant to do you any harm But sooner or later, one of us must know That you just did what you're supposed to do Sooner

Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident I'm pledging my time to you Hopin' you'll come through too  Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good They'll stone you just like they said they would They'll stone you when you're tryin' to go home Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone But I would not feel so all alone Everybody must get stoned Well, they'll stone you when you're walkin' on the street They'll stone you when you're tryin' to keep your seat They'll stone you when you're walkin' on the floor They'll stone you when you're walkin' to the door But I would not feel so all alone Everybody must get stoned They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table They'll stone you when you are young and able They'll stone you when you're tryin' to make a buck They'll stone you and then they'll say good luck Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone Everybody must get stoned Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again They'll stone you when you're riding in your car They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar Yes, but I would not feel so all alone Everybody must get stoned, alright Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone They'll stone you when you are walking home They'll stone you and then say you are brave They'll stone you when you're sent down in your grave But I would not feel so all alone Everybody must get stoned  With your mercury mouth in the missionary times And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes And your silver cross and your voice like chimes Oh, who do they think could bury you? With your pockets well-protected at last And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass And your flesh like silk and your face like glass Who could they get to carry you? Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait? With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace And your basement clothes and your hollow face Who among them did think he could outguess you? With your silhouette when the sunlight dims Into your eyes where the moonlight swims And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns Who among them would try to impress you? Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait? The kings of Tyrus, with their convict list Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss And you wouldn't know it would have happened like this But who among them really wants just to kiss you? With your childhood flames on your midnight rug And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs Who among them do you think could resist you? Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait? Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side? How could they ever mistake you? They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms How could they ever have persuaded you? Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man's come My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait? With your sheet metal memory of Cannery Row And your magazine husband who one day just had to go And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show Who among them do you think would employ you? Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole With your holy medallion in your fingertips now enfold And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul Who among them could ever think he could destroy you? Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums Should I put them by your gate, or sad-eyed lady, should I wait?  Ah, the rag man draws circles up and down the block I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape But deep inside my heart, I know I can't escape Oh, mama Can this really be the end? To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again? Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells Speaking to some French girl who says she knows me well And I would send a message to find out if she's talked But the post office has been stolen and the mailbox is locked Oh, mama Can this really be the end? To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again? Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine And I said, ""Oh, I didn't know that, but then again, there's only one I've met And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette"" Oh, mama Can this really be the end? To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again? Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control When he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes Oh, mama Can this really be the end? To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again? Now the senator came down here, showing everyone his gun Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son And me, I nearly got busted, and wouldn't it be my luck To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck? Oh, mama Is this really the end? To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again? Now the teen preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest But he cursed me when I proved to him, then I whispered, said ""Not even you can hide You see, you're just like me, I hope you're satisfied"" Oh, mama Can this really be the end? To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again? Now the rain man gave me two cures, then he said, ""Jump right in"" The one was Texas medicine, the other was just railroad gin And like a fool, I mixed them, and it strangled up my mind And now people just get uglier, and I have no sense of time Oh, mama Can this really be the end? To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again? When Ruthie says come see her in honky-tonk lagoon Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon And I say, ""Ah, come on now, you know about my debutante"" And she says, ""Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want"" Oh, mama Can this really be the end? To be stuck inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again? Now the bricks lay on Grand Street where the neon madmen climb They all fall there so perfectly, it all seems so well-timed And here I sit so patiently, waiting to find out what price You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice Oh, mama Is this really the end? To be stuck here inside of Mobile With the Memphis blues again?  Standing on your window, honey, yes, I've been here before Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door How come you don't send me no regards? You know I want your lovin', honey, why are you hard? Kneeling 'neath your ceiling, yes, I guess I've been here for a while I'm tryin' to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child How come you send someone out to have me barred? You know I want your lovin', honey, why are you hard? Like a poor fool in his prime Yes, I know you can hear me walk But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime Or is it just solid rock? Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door I watch upon your scorpion who crawls across your circus floor Just what do you think you have to guard? You know I want your lovin', honey, but you're so hard Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry, like a man in drag How come you get someone like him to be your guard? You know I want your lovin', honey, but you're so hard  Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet? We'll sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it And Louise holds a handful of rain Tempting you to defy it Lights flicker from the opposite loft In this room the heat pipes just cough The country music station plays soft But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off Just Louise And her lover, so entwined And these visions of Johanna That conquer my mind In the empty lot where the ladies play blind man's bluff with the key chain And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D Train We can hear the nightwatchman click his flashlight Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane Louise, she's alright, she's just near She's delicate and seems like the mirror But she makes it all to concise and clear That Johanna's not here The ghost of electricity Howls in the bones of her face Where these visions of Johanna Have now taken my place Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously And when bringing her name up He speaks of a farewell kiss to me He's sure got a lot of gall To be so useless and all Muttering small talk at the wall While I'm in the hall Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on And these visions of Johanna They've kept me up past the dawn Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues You can tell by the way she smiles See the primitive wallflower freeze When the jelly-faced women all sneeze Hear the one with the mustache say ""Jeez, I can't find my knees"" Both jewels and binoculars Hang from the head of the mule But these visions of Johanna They make it all seem so cruel The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him Saying, ""Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him"" But like Louise always says ""You can't look at much, can you man?"" as she herself prepares for him My Madonna, she still has not showed We see this empty cage now corrode Where her cape of the stage once had flowed The fiddler, he now steps to the road He writes ""Everything's been returned which was owed"" On the back of the fish truck that loads While my conscience explodes The harmonicas play The skeleton keys and the rain And these visions of Johanna Are now all that remain  Buckets of rain Buckets of tears Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears Buckets of moonbeams in my hand You got all the love, honey baby I can stand I been meek And hard like an oak I seen pretty people disappear like smoke Friends will arrive, friends will disappear If you want me, honey baby I'll be here I like your smile And your fingertips I like the way that you move your hips I like the cool way you look at me Everything about you is bringing me Misery Little red wagon Little red bike I ain't no monkey but I know what I like I like the way you love me strong and slow I'm takin' you with me, honey baby When I go Life is sad Life is a bust All ya can do is do what you must You do what you must do and ya do it well I do it for you, honey baby Can't you tell?  Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out quick but when they will I can only guess They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me I can't help it if I'm lucky People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that Sweet lady Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth Blowing down the backroads headin' south Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth You're an idiot, babe It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of my boxcar door You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war After losin' every battle I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see stars You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes Blood on your saddle Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb Blowing through the curtains in your room Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth You're an idiot, babe It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart. Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top You're on the bottom I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned Slowly into autumn Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth You're an idiot, babe It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I been somebody else instead Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory And all your ragin' glory I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love And it makes me feel so sorry Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats Blowing through the letters that we wrote Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves We're idiots, babe It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves  If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so. We had a falling-out, like lovers often will And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart. If you get close to her, kiss her once for me I always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin' free Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay. I see a lot of people as I make the rounds And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft. Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.  The festival was over, the boys were all plannin' for a fall The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin' in the wall The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin' wheel shut down Anyone who had any sense had already left town He was standin' in the doorway lookin' like the Jack of Hearts He moved across the mirrored room, ""Set it up for everyone,"" he said Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin' before he turned their heads Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin ""Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"" Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts Backstage the girls were playin' five-card stud by the stairs Lily had two queens, she was hopin' for a third to match her pair Outside the streets were fillin' up, the window was open wide A gentle breeze was blowin', you could feel it from inside Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine He made his usual entrance lookin' so dandy and so fine With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town She slipped in through the side door lookin' like a queen without a crown She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear ""Sorry, darlin', that I'm late,"" but he didn't seem to hear He was starin' into space over at the Jack of Hearts ""I know I've seen that face somewhere,"" Big Jim was thinkin' to himself ""Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf"" But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him Starin' at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere But she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts The hangin' judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined The drillin' in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king No, nothin' ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts Rosemary started drinkin' hard and seein' her reflection in the knife She was tired of the attention, tired of playin' the role of Big Jim's wife She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide Was lookin' to do just one good deed before she died She was gazin' to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts Lily took her dress off and buried it away ""Has your luck run out?"" she laughed at him, ""Well, I guess you must Have known it would someday Be careful not to touch the wall, there's a brand-new coat of paint I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're lookin' like a saint"" Down the hallway footsteps were comin' for the Jack of Hearts The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair ""There's something funny going on,"" he said, ""I can just feel it in the air"" He went to get the hangin' judge, but the hangin' judge was drunk As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked And Big Jim was standin' there, ya couldn't say surprised Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes She was with Big Jim but she was leanin' to the Jack of Hearts Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall And cleaned out the bank safe, it's said they got off with quite a haul In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground For one more member who had business back in town But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts The next day was hangin' day, the sky was overcast and black Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink The hangin' judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink The only person on the scene missin' was the Jack of Hearts The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, ""Closed for repair"" Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair She was thinkin' 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw Thinkin' 'bout Rosemary and thinkin' about the law But, most of all she was thinkin' 'bout the Jack of Hearts  Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha Honey, we could be in Kansas By time the snow begins to thaw. They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn Honey you wouldn't know it by me Every day's been darkness since you been gone. Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind Little rooster crowin', there must be something on his mind Well, I feel just like that rooster Honey, ya treat me so unkind. Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above Well, you know I even outrun the hound dogs Honey, you know I've earned your love. Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship Ain't that just like my heart, babe When you kissed my lips?  'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood When blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm. ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved Everything up to that point had been left unresolved Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed Just to think that it all began on an noneventful morn ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove And old men with broken teeth stranded without love Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn? ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes I bargained for salvation an' she gave me a lethal dose I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm"" Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""  They sat together in the park As the evening sky grew dark She looked at him and he felt a spark Tingle to his bones 'Twas then he felt alone And wished that he'd gone straight And watched out for a simple twist of fate They walked alone by the old canal A little confused, I remember well And stopped into a strange hotel With a neon burning bright He felt the heat of the night Hit him like a freight- Train moving with a simple twist of fate A saxophone someplace far off played As she was walking on by the arcade As the light bust through a beat up shade Where he was waking up She dropped a coin into the cup Of a blind man at the gate And forgot about a simple twist of fate He woke up; the room was bare He didn't see her anywhere He told himself he didn't care Pushed the window open wide Felt an emptiness inside To which he just could not relate Brought on by a simple twist of fate He hears the ticking of the clocks And walks along with a parrot that talks Hunts her down by the waterfront docks Where the sailors all come in Maybe she'll pick him out again How long must he wait One more time for a simple twist of fate People tell me it's a sin To know and feel too much within I still believe she was my twin But I lost the ring She was born in spring But I was born too late Blame it on a simple twist of fate  Early one morning, the sun was shining I was laying in bed Wondering if she'd changed it all If her hair was still red Her folks, they said our lives together Sure was gonna be rough They never did like mama's homemade dress Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough And I was standing on the side of the road Rain falling on my shoes Heading out for the east coast Lord knows I've paid some dues getting through Tangled up in blue She was married when we first met Soon to be divorced I helped her out of a jam, I guess But I used a little too much force We drove that car as far as we could Abandoned it out west Split up on a dark, sad night Both agreeing it was best She turned around to look at me As I was walking away I heard her say over my shoulder ""We'll meet again someday on the avenue"" Tangled up in blue I had a job in the great north woods Working as a cook for a spell But I never did like it all that much And one day the axe just fell So I drifted down to New Orleans Where I's lucky for to be employed Working for a while on a fishing boat Right outside of Delacroix But all the while I was alone The past was close behind I seen a lot of women But she never escaped my mind and I just grew Tangled up in blue She was working in a topless place And I stopped in for a beer I just kept looking at the sight of her face In the spotlight so clear And later on when the crowd thinned out I's just about to do the same She was standing there in back of my chair Said, ""Tell me, don't I know your name?"" I muttered something underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face I must admit I felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe Tangled up in blue She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe ""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said ""You look like the silent type"" Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burning coal Pouring off of every page Like it was written in my soul from me to you Tangled up in blue I lived with them on Montague Street In a basement down the stairs There was music in the cafés at night And revolution in the air Then he started into dealing with slaves And something inside of him died She had to sell everything she owned And froze up inside And when finally the bottom fell out I became withdrawn The only thing I knew how to do Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue So now I'm going back again I got to get her somehow All the people we used to know They're an illusion to me now Some are mathematicians Some are carpenter's wives Don't know how it all got started I don't what they do with their lives But me, I'm still on the road Heading for another joint We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point of view Tangled up in blue  Our conversation was short and sweet It nearly swept me offa my feet And I'm back in the rain Oh, and you are on dry land You made it there somehow You're a big girl now Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence He's singing his song for me at his own expense And I'm just like that bird Oh, singing just for you I hope that you can hear Hear me singing through these tears Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast Oh but what a shame, that all we've shared can't last I can change I swear Oh, see what you can do I can make it through You can make it too Love is so simple, to quote a phrase You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days Oh I know where I can find you Oh, in somebody's room It's a price I have to pay You're a big girl all the way A change in the weather is known to be extreme But what's the sense in changing horses in midstream I'm going out of my mind Oh, with a pain that stops and starts Like a corkscrew to my heart Ever since we've been apart  I've seen love go by my door It's never been this close before Never been so easy or so slow I been shootin' in the dark too long When something's not right it's wrong You're gonna make me lonesome when you go Dragon clouds so high above I've only known careless love It always has hit me from below But this time 'round it's more correct Right on target so direct You're gonna make me lonesome when you go Purple clover, Queen Anne lace Crimson hair across your face You can make me cry but you don't know Can't remember what I was thinking of You might be spoiling me too much love You're gonna make me lonesome when you go Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme Blue river running slow and lazy I could stay with you forever and never realize the time Situations have ended sad Relationships have all been bad Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's But there's no way I can compare All them scenes to this affair You're gonna make me lonesome when you go You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing Staying far behind without you You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying You're gonna make me give myself a good talking to I'll look for you in old Honolulu San Francisco or Ashtabula You're gonna have to leave me now I know But I'll see you in the sky above In the tall grass in the ones I love You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  I first heard this Rick von Schmidt.

Johnny_Cash,"Children go where I send thee, How will I send thee, I'm gonna send thee one by one Cause the one was the little bitty baby.  The gates and doors were barred And all the windows fastened down I spent the night in sleeplessness And rose at every sound Half in hope of sorrow And half in fear the day Would find the soldiers breakin' through To drag us all away And just before the sunrise I heard somethin' at the wall The gate began to rattle And a voice began to call I hurried to the window Looked down into the street Expecting swords and torches And the sound of soldiers' feet But there was no one there but Mary So I went down to let her in And John stood there beside me As she told me where, she'd been ""They've moved Him in the night And none of us knows where The Stone's been rolled away And now His body isn't there"" We both ran toward the garden Then John ran on ahead We found the stone and empty tomb Just the way that Mary said But the windin' sheet they wrapped Him in Was just an empty shell And how or where, they'd taken Him Was more than I could tell Oh, somethin' strange had happened there Just what I did not know John believed a miracle But I just turned to go Circumstance and speculation Couldn't lift me very high I'd seen them crucify Him And I saw Him die Back inside the house again The guilt and anguish came Everything, I had promised Him Just added to my shame When at last it came to choices I denied, I knew His name And even if He were alive It wouldn't be the same Suddenly the air was filled With a strange and sweet perfume Light that came from everywhere Drove shadows from the room And Jesus stood before me With His arms held open wide I fell down on my knees And I just clung to Him and cried He raised me to my feet And as I looked into His eyes The love was shining out from Him Like sunlight from the skies Guilt in my confusion Disappeared in sweet release And every fear I ever had Just melted into peace He's alive, He's alive He's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide He's alive, He's alive He's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide He's alive, He's alive He's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide He's alive, He's alive, He's alive, He's alive  I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man and on a rock I stand I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man and on a rock I stand I'm a newborn man He put a light on me He put a light on me He put a light on me He put a light on me so now I can see He put a light on me He loves me all the time He loves me all the time He loves me all the time He loves me all of the time, I'm His and He's mine He loves me all the time I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man and on the rock I stand I'm a newborn man I was dying and the time was flying And I heard Him calling me My will was bent and I did repent And His sweet love set me free I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man and on a rock I stand I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man I'm a newborn man and on the rock I stand I'm a newborn man  I'm gonna try to be that way Once upon a time there lived a man Many years ago in a foreign land Knew how to live right, tried to be a light Gave everybody a helping hand I'm gonna try to be that way I'm gonna try to be that way Do the kind of things a man oughta do Say the kind of things a man oughta say I'm gonna try to be that way He never done anybody wrong He tried to help everybody 'long He brought a better land to make a better man Out of the rich or the poor Or the weak or the strong And he preached love and brotherhood He went around doin' good, doin' good Everywhere he went They knew that he was sent And the people started actin' like they should  I've got Jesus in my soul It's the only way I know Watching every move I make Guiding every step I take I've got Jesus in my soul I was lifted one night by God's blinding light And it shook me right out of my sleep As His love entered in it washed away my sin And I praise Him down on my knees I've got Jesus in my soul It's the only way I know Watching every move I make Guiding every step I take I've got Jesus in my soul Even though as a sinner I was no beginner And I'm glad that I never made the grave Yes I'm thankful everyday for the prayers that were made They were answered and my soul was saved I've got Jesus in my soul It's the only way I know Watching every move I make Guiding every step I take I've got Jesus in my soul I was lifted one night by God's blinding light And it shook me right out of my sleep As His love entered in it washed away my sin And I praise Him down on my knees  There are some people, who say we cannot tell, Whether we are saved or, whether all is well; They say we only can hope and, trust that it is so, But I was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know. Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (yes, He saved my soul), The very moment He forgave me (yes, He made me whole); He took away my heavy burden (yes, He took my sin and), And He gave me peace within (gave me peace within). Satan can't make me doubt it (he can't make me doubt it), It's real and I'm gonna shout it (I'm gonna shout it); 'Cause I was there when it happened (oh, my Lord), And I guess I ought to know (yes, I ought to know). Now, I don't care who tells me, salvation is not real, Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel; The heavy burdens lifted and the vile sins go, But I was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know.  Lay me down in dixie, let the world go by me, I'm gonna stay right there till Gabriel calls Pull your dreams around me, wrap me in your memory, Lord, I love dixie most of all Somewhere in the land where the warm sun is shining Somewhere someone's speaking in the warm southern brogue Lay me down in dixie, where they understand me, Lord, I love dixie most of all Lay me down in dixie, and when they come to take me, You know that I'll be ready when they call For I have seen the daylight, so I do not fear the midnight, Lord, I love dixie most of all Somewhere in the land where the warm sun is shining Somewhere someone's speaking in the warm southern brogue Lay me down in dixie, where they understand me, Lord, I love dixie most of all Lord, I love dixie most of all  My latest sun is sinking fast, My race is nearly run; My strongest trials now are past, My triumph is begun. Oh, come, angel band, Come and around me stand; Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings To my eternal home; Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings To my eternal home. I know I'm near the holy ranks Of friends and kindred dear- I hear the waves on Jordan's banks, The crossing must be near. I've almost reached my heav'nly home, My spirit loudly sings; Thy holy ones, behold, they come! I hear the noise of wings. Oh, bear my longing heart to Him, Who bled and died for me; Whose blood now cleanses from all sin, And gives me victory.

The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways a story of tragedy, Like that day at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. Big Foot was an Indian chief Of the Minneconjou band, A band of Minneconjou Sioux From South Dakota land. Big Foot said to Custer, ""Stay away from Crazy Horse."" But Custer crossed into Sioux land, And he never came back across. Then Big Foot led his people To a place called Wounded Knee, And they found themselves surrounded By the 7th Cavalry. Big chief Big Foot, Rise up from your bed, Minneconjou babies cry For their mothers lying dead. Big Foot was down with a fever When he reached Wounded Knee; And his people all were prisoners Of the 7th Cavalry. Two hundred women and children And another hundred men Raised up a white flag of peace, But peace did not begin. An accidental gunshot And Big Foot was first to die; And over the noise of the rifles You could hear the babies cry. Big chief Big Foot, It's good that you can't see Revenge is being wrought By Custer's 7th Cavalry. Then smoke hung over the canyon On that cold December day. All was death and dying Around where Big Foot lay. Farther on up the canyon Some had tried to run and hide; But death showed no favorites, Women, men, and children died. One side called it a ""massacre,"" The other a ""victory,"" But the white flag is still waving Today at Wounded Knee. Big chief Big Foot, Your Minneconjou band Is more than remembered here In South Dakota land.  And she spread her wings and she flew Yup, the nation was flying now Taken to the air, in few hours time you could fly over All those trails blazed by the pioneers Phonographs were playing the hit songs of the day Alexanders ragtime band My mother was a lady and here's a song my mama sing Back about 1910 or 1915 Come take a trip in my airship Come take a trip round the stars Come take a sail around Venus Come take a sail around Mars No one to watch while we're kissin' No one to see while we spoon Come take a trip in my airship We'll visit the man in the moon  Like a young cold the country was now growing fast Passenger trains in the east were traveling a hundred miles an hour People in the country could buy clothes by mail order And get 'em back within two weeks After twenty years or more the South Was still mending its wounds from the civil war But with all the country's problems The union was solid Red American novelists and poets Were coming into their own People were expressing their love For America in song and in poem And in South Carolina A high tone southern gentleman Expressed his love and admiration For his president James A Garfield in such a way  The years creep slowly by, lorena, The snow is on the grass again; The sun's low down the sky, lorena, The frost gleams where the flowers have been. But my heart beats on as warmly now, As when the summer days were nigh; The sun can never dip so low, Or down affections cloudless sky. A hundred months have passed, lorena, Since last I held that hand in mine, And felt the pulse beat fast, lorena, Though mine beat faster far than thine. A hundred months, 'twas flowery may, When up the hilly slope we climbed, To watch the dying of the day, And hear the distant church bells chime. We loved each other then, lorena, More than we ever dared to tell; And what we might have been, lorena, Had but our lovings prospered well. But then, 'tis past, the years are gone, I'll not call up their shadowy forms; I'll say to them, ""lost years, sleep on! Sleep on! nor heed life's pelting storms."" The story of that past, lorena, Alas! I care not to repeat, The hopes that could not last, lorena, They lived, but only lived to cheat. I would not cause e'en one regret To rankle in your bosom now; For ""if we try, we may forget,"" Were words of thine long years ago. Yes, these were words of thine, lorena, They burn within my memory yet; They touched some tender chords, lorena, Which thrill and tremble with regret. 'Twas not thy woman's heart that spoke; Thy heart was always true to me: A duty, stern and pressing, broke The tie which linked my soul with thee. It matters little now, lorena, The past is in the eternal past; Our heads will soon lie low, lorena, Life's tide is ebbing out so fast. There is a future! o, thank god! Of life this is so small a part! 'Tis dust to dust beneath the sod; But there, up there, 'tis heart to heart.  Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low Me and my brother was down close to the depot when I heard the report of a pistol My brother run out and come back in all excited And I said what was it and he said it was the report of a pistol and then he said Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low Lord I knew the President was supposed to be at the depot that day And we just would't believe that he's shot But we'd run over there and there was so many folks around That we couldn't see him but some lady was standin' there cryin' And I said m'am what was it that happened m'am and she said Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low Well everybody drifted off toward home finally And they looked like they felt about as bad as I did But in a few weeks I heard that the President was still alive And I told my brother I said let's get on that train and go to where he's laid up hurt Well when we got to his big house up there I asked the fellow I said who was it that did it who was it that shoot the President And he said it was Charlie Guiteau that shoot Mr. Garfield and I said Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man good man Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low I heard some fellow there that had been in the house to see the President And I sidled up him to listen to what he was tellin' and he said Mrs Lucretia Garfield was always at his side In the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot He said that just that day the President said to Mrs Lucretia He said Crete honey (he called her Crete) Said if somethin' worse happens to me after awhile you get yourself a good man And Mrs Lucretia said James (she called him James) She said I won't hear to that now she said I love you too much but he said You'll make some good man a good wife good wife You'll make some man a good good good wife (Don't pull in single harness all your life good gal Don't pull in single harness all your life) That's what he said don't pull in single harness all your life Well a few days later I come back to where the President was restin' And it seems everybody was cryin' The flag was hangin' halfway up to the flagpole in front of the house And everybody looked so sad and I asked a soldier boy there And I said is is is Mr. Garfield and he said yeah he's gone Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground down low Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground Well they laid the President by that long cold branch Mr. Garfield's been laid down low Mr. Garfield has been shot dow Mr. Garfield's been shot (Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low)  Now the nation moved on wheels Will Rogers said we hold the distinction on being the only nation In the history of the world ever to go to the poorhouse in an automobile Ha ha ha well the country went to the poorhouse all right Then it got back to its feet To become the mose powerful nation in the history of the world  Dialogue: We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, Had to have men like Columbus, De Soto, Lewis and Clark, Kit Carson, Daniel Boone, David Crockett, Eli Whitney, Sam Colt, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Orville and Wilbur Wright, my grandpa, and Paul Revere.  And the shining Rocky Mountains looked down on the people coming Strong and sturdy freedom lovin' settlers cowboys pioneers Now no foreign crown would rule them Now a nation strong was standing even bigger was it growing Added Iowa, Wisconsin then broke through the shining mountains Staked a claim on California Panned the gold out of its rivers irrigated desert valleys Oregon, Minnesota, Kansas now were added to the total Making 34 to number of the States now in the Union And the years 1860 to 65 the history books're full of it The sadness the heartbreak and the songs of that period Tell us of a sadness and of a heartbreak when the nation was torn asunder  In April of 1775 This great nation started comin' alive Ol' King George didn't like it one bit So he proceeded to throw him a royal fit He told his generals better get 'em back in line Make 'em pay my taxes now America is mine Stop that Independence cops before it gets around Or it'll gonna be hard to hold them rebels down Well the King was talking 'bout the men like Paul Revere And the minute men who held their dream of Independence dear They kept their eyes on the British they watched 'em day and night They knew very soon they'd get their chance to stand and fight Yes they knew that the British would get movin' any hour So they arranged a signal in the Northern Church Tower Paul was watchin' when the tower showed a light And he started on his midnight ride He jumped on his horse hoofs started a hummin' He screamed out his warning redcoats're comin' Better get your guns and your fightin' britches on They're comin' and they're eight hundred strong Next mornin' at Concord and Lexington town The spirit of freedom turned the redcoats around When we praise the men who made this mighty nation we have here Then let's remember Paul Revere yes let's remember Paul Revere I guarantee you somethin' and I wanna tell you all That we never would've been here if it hadn't been for Paul Yes sir I surely doubt us ever bein' here If it hadn't been for that man on that horse named Mr Revere  Add Alaska and Hawaii make the total half a hundred Half a hundred states united joined together as one body Arms that reach across the northland to the far off state Alaska Arms that reach across the water to the far off state Hawaii Arms of some two hundred million Thanking God for having brought us safely thus far in our journey We're reaching for the stars that beckon reaching for the stars that call us And we answer back still louder by the power of God that brought us We are reaching we are reaching reaching for the stars tomorrow  A hundred and eighty were challenged by Travis to die  By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was high  Any man that will fight to the death cross over  But if you want to live you'd better fly  And over the line went a hundred and seventy nine  Hey Santa Anna we're killing your soldiers below  That men wherever they go will remember the Alamo  Ol' Bowie lay dying his powder was ready and dry  Flat on his back Bowie killed them a few in reply  And young Davy Crockett was singing and laughing with gallantry fears in his eyes  For God and for freedom a man more than willing to die  Hey Santa Anna...  They sent a young scout from the battlements bloody and loud  With the words of farewell from a garrison valiant and proud  Grieve not little darling my dying if Texas is sovereign and free  We'll never surrender and ever with liberty be  Hey Santa Anna...  Added to their thirteen colonies Tennessee, Vermont, Kentucky  Louisiana and Ohio and Mississippi and Indiana Alabama Maine Missouri  Added Arakansas and Michigan added Florida and Texas  And in Texas five thousand men under Santa Anna  Had crossed the Rio Grande headed for San Antonio  David Crockett left Tennessee with the volunteers headed for San Antonio  At a Spanish mission near San Antonio they met a knife-fighter  And a gambler named Jim Bowie and a Britisher named Travis  One hundred eighty Americans against five thousand to the death  In 1814 we took a little trip Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip. We took a little bacon and we took a little beans And we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans. We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin'. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' on Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. We looked down the river and we see'd the British come. And there must have been a hundred of'em beatin' on the drum. They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring. We stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing. We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin'. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' on Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise If we didn't fire our muskets till we looked 'em in the eye We held our fire till we see'd their faces well. Then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave 'em ... well We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin'. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' on Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go. They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. We fired our cannon till the barrel melted down. So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round. We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind. We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin'. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' on Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go. They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  I think sir the battle is over, and the young soldier lay down his gun. I'm tired of running for cover, I'm certain the battle is done. For see over there where we fought them, it's quiet for they've all gone away. All left is the dead and the dying, the blue lying long side the grave. So you think the battle is over, and you even lay down your gun. You carelessly rise from your cover, for you think the battle is done. Now boy hit the dirt, listen to me, for I'm still the one in command. Get flat on the ground here beside me, and lay your heart to the sand. Can you hear the deafening rumble, can you feel the trembling ground. It's not just the horses and wagons that make such a deafening sound. For every shot fired had an echo and every man killed wanted life. There lies your friend Jim McKinney, can you take the news to his wife? No son the battle's not over, the battle has only begun. The rest of the battle will cover the part that has blackened the sun. The fight yet to come is not with cannon, nor will the fight be hand-to-hand No one will regroup the forces, no charge will a general command. The battle will rage in the bosom of mother and sweetheart and wife. Brother and sister and daughter will grieve for the rest of their lives. Now go ahead, rise from your cover, be thankful that God let you live. Go fight the rest of the battle for those who gave all they could give. I see sir the battle's not over, the battle has only begun The rest of the battle will cover this part that has blackened the sun. For though there's no sound of the cannon and though there's no smoke in the sky. I'm dropping the gun and the saber and ready for battle am I.  ""Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.""  We're goin' west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap  Down the wilderness road  The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road  The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap  There was a time when goin' way out west meant goin' to Kaintuck  The dark and bloody ground as Indians called it  Indians wars were ragin' and men like Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner  Came down the wilderness road like countless families did  Through a place in south West Virginia called Big Moccasin Gap  It's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kids with me  Daniel Boone lost his boy the other day young Jim Boone is dead twenty miles away  The wagons turn and went back home even Daniel couldn't make it alone  I guess prob'ly Daniel could but he stopped awhile in castle wood  (If you love your wife and love your baby man  Turn your wagons back as soon as you can  Ev'ry Injun in these hills has gone berserk you never gonna make it to Kaintuck)  Ah I bet I'm gonna make it to Kaintuck  We're goin' west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap  Down the wilderness road  The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road  The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap  The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road  The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap  These are my people These are my people this is the land where my forefathers lie These are my people in brotherhood we're heirs of a creed to live by A creed that proclaims that by loved ones blood stains This is my land and these are my people These are my people they were born on and lived by the land These are my people and their cities were raised by hard working hands And their faces to tell that they're holding on well To this their land yes these are my people These are my people these are the ones who will reach for the stars These are my people that a light of the earth you can tell they are ours A new step to take and a new day will break For this my land yes these are my people these're my people hmm **********  Then came West Virginia came Nevada and Nebraska Colorado and Dakota, Washington, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming And the West was opened up And for ther first time it seems That the nation was really conscious of itself as a nation Railroad tracks crossed the land as did telegraph wires Public opinion and great ideas were now reflected on a national basis And never in this land before us and never more hereafter Will a land know such a people as a man we call a cowboy His hat and his bandana his unique brand of lingo All his devil deeds of daring bold and skillful in the saddle Brave and daring in the rambling wild and eager in exploring Land that calls him with a challenge But the land was already claimed by a people When the cowboy came and when the soldiers came The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways a story of tragedy Like that day at Wounded Knee South Dakota  Yes, went they through the Lehigh Valley To Lake Erie past Virginia And the land called out its challenge Bring your men to match our mountains See the green Ohio Valley See the Cumberland, the Wabash On the Tennessee they floated On great rafts to the Mississippi And the Cherokee and Shawnee And the Creek and The Ojibwa And the Choctaw and the Quapaw And all the tribes along the rivers [Incomprehensible] that they were coming That the white man was upon them They built their homes along the rivers Built their churches, brought their preachers Came upon the white misery Stopped before the shining mountains Many died from the beginning For the freedom of America Like that day down in New Orleans  I know that hearts were loving Long before I was here. And I'm not the first to ever cry In my bed or in my beer. There were songs before there was radio Of love that stays And love that goes. They were writing meloncholy tunes And tearful words that rhyme. Before my time. Before my time. There were songs in old dusty books Of love that's always been. Sweet lovers in their glory Who are now gone with the wind. Old fashioned love words spoken Then keep coming back around again Nothing's changed except the name, Their love burned just like mine. Before my time. Before my time. And in the dim of yesterday I can clearly see That flesh and blood Cried out to someone As it does in me. And there was some old song that said, ""I love you till I die."" Before my time. Before my time. But what the old time master's had Is what I feel for you. Love is love and doesn't change In a century or two. If someway they had seen and knew How it would be for me and you They'd wish for love like yours And they would wish for love like mine. Before my time. Before my time.  I got a crib full of corn, and a turnin' plow But the grounds to wet for the hopper now. Got a cultivator and a double tree A leather line for the HAW and gee Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash I'm doing alright for Country Trash I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day I got about a dollar laid away The winds from the south and the fishings good Got a pot belly stove and a CORD of wood Mama turns the left-overs into hash I'm doing alright for Country Trash I got a MACKINAW and a hunting dog A cap I ordered from the catolog A good tall tree that shades the yard A good fat sow for the winters lard Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash  I'm doing alright for Country Trash Well there's not much new ground left to plow  And the crops need fertilizer now  My hands don't earn me too much gold  For security when I grow old  But we'll all be equal under the grass  And God's got a heaven for Country Trash And  God's got a heaven for Country Trash  I'll be doing alright for Country Trash  Field of diamonds in the sky Worlds are whirling right on by Are you wondering who am i Field of diamonds in the sky Am I just a star in some crown Or someone's life sun going down, down, down Field of diamonds in the sky Silent beauty shining high Are you tears the angels cry Field of diamonds in the sky Field of diamonds in the sky Like the night you pass me by I could touch you if I try Field of diamonds in the sky Am I just a star in some crown Or someone's life sun going down, down, down Field of diamonds in the sky Silent beauty shining high Are you tears the angels cry Field of diamonds in the sky  Hold on honey I'd like to say I'm busting out and breaking away I'm letting you go like a hot horse shoe I can't take another heart ache from you Think about how it's gonna be When you start back to needing me When your dancing shoes have lost their shine I'm gonna be gone in mine I'm leaving now I'm leaving now Get out of my face Get out of my place I'm leaving now, adios I'm leaving now And the time it comes when you trim the fat Feed the kitchen scraps to the front seat cat Bye bye baby when the bills come due You might have to sell a jewel or two Eat your heart out anyway It's hard as your head and it's cold as clay It's all over now you won't have me Your sugar daddy or your money tree I'm leaving now yeah I'm leaving now Get out of my space Get out of my face I'm leaving now, hey hey I'm leaving now Pull up the collar on my traveling coat Sell that miserable pleasure boat I wouldn't give another nickel for another buck I'm living on muscle, guts, and luck If anybody asks where did I go Tell 'em I went where the wild goose goes I wouldn't have me an area code Don't have a number, don't need a row I'm leaving now, me to I'm leaving now Get out of my face Get out of my space I'm leaving now, adios I'm leaving now I'm leaving now I'm leaving now Get out of my space Get out of my face I'm leaving now, adios I'm leaving now  Well you're my friend  And can you see  Many times, we've been out drinking  Many times we've shared our thoughts  But did you ever, ever notice The kind of thoughts I got? Well you know I have a love A love for everyone I know And you know I have a drive To live I won't let go But can you see its opposition Comes rising up sometimes? That its dreadful imposition Comes blacking in my mind? And that I see a darkness  And that I see a darkness And that I see a darkness And that I see a darkness Did you know how much I love you? Here's a hope that somehow you Can save me from this darkness Well I hope that someday buddy We have peace in our lives Together or apart Alone or with our wives And we can stop our whoring And pull the smiles inside And light it up forever And never go to sleep My best unbeaten brother This isn't all I see Oh no, I see a darkness Oh no, I see a darkness Oh no, I see a darkness Oh no, I see a darkness Did you know how much I love you? Here's a hope that somehow you Can save me from this darkness  Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment. Hopefully we will be able to in the future. Until then... how about a  random page ?  It was on one cold winter night When the wind blew across the wild moor When Mary came wandering home with her child 'Til she came to her own father's door ""Father, dear Father,"" she cried. ""Come down and open the door Or the child in my arms will perish and die From the winds that blow across the wild moor."" But her father was deaf to her cry Not a sound of her voice did he hear So the watch dogs did howl and the village bells tolled And the wind blew across the wild moor Oh, how the old man must have felt When he came to the door, the next morn' And he found Mary dead, but the child still alive Closely grasping it's dead mother's arms. In grief the old man passed away And the child, to its mother, went soon And no one, they say, lives there to this day And the cottage, to ruin, has gone. But the villagers point out the spot Where the willows grew over the door Saying there Mary died, once the gay village bride From the wind that blew across the wild moor.  When life seems full, of clouds and rain And I'm full, of nothin' but pain Who soothes my thumpin', bumpin' brain? Nobody When Wintertime comes, with its snow and sleet And me with hunger, and cold feet Who says ""Here's two bits, go and eat""? Nobody Well, I ain't never done nothin' to nobody I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time And until I get something from somebody, sometime I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time When Summertime comes, all warm and clear And my friends see me, drawin' near Who says ""Come on in and have a beer""? Nobody Well one time when things was, lookin' bright I started to whittlin' on a stick one night Who said ""Hey! That's dynamite!""? Nobody Mmmm, I ain't never done nothin' to nobody I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time And until I get something from somebody, sometime I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time I ain't never done nothin' to nobody I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time And until I get something from somebody, sometime I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time  Is it getting better? Or do you feel the same? Will it make it easier on you, now You got someone to blame You said one love, one life When it's one need, in the night One love, we get to share it It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it Did I disappoint you? Or leave a bad taste in your mouth? You act like you never had love And you want me to go without Well it's, too late, tonight To drag the past out into the light We're one, but we're not the same We get to, carry each other, carry each other One Have you come here for forgiveness? Have you come to raise the dead? Have you come here to play Jesus To the lepers in your head? Did I ask too much, more than a lot? You gave me nothing, now it's all I got We're one, but we're not the same Well, we hurt each other, and we're doing it again You said Love is a temple, love - a higher law Love is a temple, love - the higher law You asked me to enter, but then you made me crawl And I can't be holding on, to what you got When all you got is hurt One love, one blood One life, you've got to do what you should One life with each other: sisters, brothers One life, but we're not the same We get to carry each other, carry each other One One One One  Melinda was mine 'Til the time That I found her Holding Jim And lovin' Him Then Sue came along Loved me strong That's what I thought Me and Sue But that died, too Don't know that I will But until I can find me A girl who'll stay And won't play games behind me I'll be what I am A solitary man Solitary man I've had it to here Bein' where Love's a small word A part-time thing A paper ring I know it's been done Havin' one Girl who loves me Right or wrong Weak or strong Don't know that I will But until I can find me The girl who'll stay And won't play games behind me I'll be what I am A solitary man Solitary man Don't know that I will But until love can find me And a girl who'll stay And won't play games behind me I'll be what I am A solitary man A solitary man Solitary man  Up in the mornin', out on the job Work like the devil for my pay. But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do But roll around heaven all day. Had a fuss with my woman, an' I toil for my kids, An' I sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray, While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do But roll around heaven all day. Oh, Lord above, don't you hear me cryin' Tears are rollin' down my eyes. Send in a cloud with a silver linin', Take me to paradise. Show me that river, Take me across, Wash all my troubles away Like that lucky old sun give me nothing to do But roll around heaven all day.  It ALL began when they come took me from my home And put me on Death Row, A crime for which I am totally innocent, you know. I began to warm and chill To objects and their fields, A ragged cup, a twisted mop The face of Jesus in my soup Those sinister dinner deals The meal trolley's wicked wheels A hooked bone rising from my food All things either good or ungood. And the mercy seat is waiting And I think my head is burning And in a way I'm yearning To be done with all this weighing of the truth. An eye for an eye And a tooth for a tooth And anyway I told the truth And I'm not afraid to die. I hear stories from the chamber Christ was born into a manger And like some ragged stranger He died upon the cross Might I say, it seems so fitting in its way He was a carpenter by trade Or at least that's what I'm told My kill-hand's Tatooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist. In Heaven His throne is made of gold The ark of his Testament is stowed A throne from which I'm told All history does unfold. It's made of wood and wire And my body is on fire And God is never far away. Into the mercy seat I climb My head is shaved, my head is wired And like a moth that tries To enter the bright eye I go shuffling out of life Just to hide in death awhile And anyway I never lied. And the mercy seat is waiting And I think my head is burning And in a way I'm yearning To be done with all this weighing of the truth. An eye for an eye And a tooth for a tooth And anyway I told the truth And I'm not afraid to die. And the mercy seat is burning And I think my head is glowing And in a way I'm hoping To be done with all this twisting of the truth. An eye for an eye And a tooth for a tooth And anyway there was no proof And I'm not afraid to die. And the mercy seat is glowing And I think my head is smoking And in a way I'm hoping To be done with all these looks of disbelief. A life for a life And a truth for a truth And I've got nothing left to lose And I'm not afraid to die. And the mercy seat is smoking And I think my head is melting And in a way that's helping To be done with all this twisting of the truth An eye for an eye And a tooth for a tooth And anyway I told the truth But I'm afraid I told a lie.  I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger Traveling through this world of woe There's no sickness, no toil, no danger In that bright land to which I go I'm going there to see my Father I'm going there no more to roam I'm only going over Jordan I'm only going over home I know dark clouds will hang 'round me I know my way is rough and steep Yet beauteous fields lie just before me Where God's redeemed their vigils keep I'm going there to see my mother She said she'd meet me when I come I'm only going over Jordan I'm only going over home  Would you lay with me in a field of stone If my needs were strong would you lay with me Should my lips grow dry would you wet them dear In the midnight hour if my lips were dry Would you go away to another land Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand Wipe the blood away from my dying hand If I give my self to you Would you bathe me with me in the stream of life When the moon is full would you bathe with me Will you still love me when I'm down and out In my time of trials will you stand by me Would you go away to another land Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand Wipe the blood away from my dying hand If I give my self to you Would you lay with me in a field of stone If my lips grew dry would you "

(P): Podgy the bear and Jasper were huddled around the unlit fire in the centre of the room. ""There are no more matches left, Podgy,"" said Jasper. ""Then buy some, Jasper, old friend,"" said Podgy. ""Make a list and afterwards we'll go to the shop and buy matches and (*buy?) candles and buns."" ""There's no more paper to write on, Podgy"" ""No need to worry, Jasper. You keep saying to yourself 'matches' and I'll keep saying 'candles' until we reach the shop. Then we won't need to write it down. We'll remember."" ""Who'll remember the buns, Podgy?"" ""We both will, Jasper... Matches,"" ""Candles."" ""Matches."" ""Candles."" ""Matches."" ""Candles."" ""Matches."" ""Candles."" ""Matches."" ""Candles"" (J): In the long dark corridors of Felpin Mansions, a door slams and the shadowy figure of Count Balder appears. The Count is the eccentric son of Baron Lndsberg, the inventor of the rack. He speaks ""Guten Tagen, meinen damen and herren. Welcome to Felpin Mansions. The butler will show you to your rooms. Butler!"" ""Yes, sir!"" ""Show the ladies and gentlemen to their rooms"" (P): Come in (J): May I come in? (P): Come, come in, Count! (J): May I? (P): Oh, yes, come in (J): Ah, thank you. I was wondering if you knew any of the songs from the good 'ol days (P): Oh, my goodness, yes. Don't you worry on that score. I hear the Baron likes, uh, I hear the Baron likes the good old tunes (J): Yes, I do (P): So do I, Count, so do I. But they're all melodies, aren't they? (P): No, don't worry. I'll play this one. Do you like this one? Listen to this one (P): (Singing) Please don't bring your banjo bag I know where it's been I wasn't hardly gone a day When it became the scene Banjos, banjos all the time I can't forget that tune (All): (Singing) And if I ever see another banjo I'm going out to buy a big balloon And if I ever see another banjo I'm going out to buy a big balloon And if I ever see another banjo I'm going out to buy a toy balloon And if I ever see another banjo I'm going out to buy a toy balloon And if I ever see another bloom I'm going out to buy a toy balloon (P): Yes, everywhere it's Christmas (P): (Singing) Ev'rywhere it's Christmas Ev'rywhere it's song London, Paris, Rome and New York Tokyo, Hong Kong Oh, ev'rywhere it's Christmas And I'm off to join the cheer! Ev'rywhere it's Christmas At the end of ev'ry year! Oh, ev'rywhere it's Christmas At the end of ev'ry year! I said that ev'rywhere it's Christmas At the end of ev'ry year! One more time now! Ev'rywhere it's Christmas At the end of ev'ry year (P): (*Ha-ha-ha?) Jolly good, (*ho-ho?) jolly good  Hoo! (All): Good King Wenceslas looked out On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!) As the slow ray round about Deep and crisp and crispy Brightly show the boot last night On the mosty cruel Henry Hall and David Lloyd Betty Grable too-ooh-ooh (J): Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already. But we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when  Please Please Me  became a number one hit and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show. This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because ""Love Me Do"" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime: Garry Crimble to you Garry Mimble to you Getty Bable, dear Christmas Happy Birthday me too (P): This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like jelly babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off jelly babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing. (Yes! Yes! Oh yes!) Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio (yes, we enjoy that very kindly) to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop, (Stop! Stop!) and Ringo, (Stop! Stop! Shouting those animals!) so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription. Ja, das wird uns danke schon Und denn gruss von even Ja, denn gruss von even schon Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy Danke schon Ja, Ringo! (R): Hello, Ringo here. As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups... (Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas) Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted. (Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas) King Wenceslas: Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!) On the feast of Stephen (Hey!) When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!) Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!) Hooray! (G): Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!) I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters. And I'd just like to say: Brightly was the shone that night Though the winter cruel When a pork pie came inside Gathering winter cruel (All): Rudolph, the red nosed reindeer (Ho!)

Good evening to you one and all I hope you will enjoy The coming sports day of your life Is mama's little boy. (Y): So, how do you like the garden here? (J): I think it's simply splendid.

And a good time to be had by All. (P): (Singing) ""Merry Christmas! Mm, this is to wish you a me-merry, merry Christmas, This is to wish you a ha-ha-happy new year."" (J): How do you see your place in the ...eh... the seventies to Come? We've had the swinging sixties, and I was wondering, Mrs. Lennon, how you Saw your place in the seventies? (Y): I think it'll be a quiet, peaceful seventies, hopefully, you know. (J): So you think there's gonna be peace, do you? (Y): Yes, and freedom. (J): I see. (Y): Freedom of mind. And everything. (J): I see. Really nice. (Y): Everybody will just be flying around, you know. (J): Ah, everybody will just be flying around, you see. D'you Understand that? (Y): The air's so crisp and all that.

Si por el gobierno fuera los raperos no existieran. Nos lanzaran al calabozo y con la pena de muerte nos dieran. Esta el que pisotea y el que ayuda al ser humano, Existe el buen amigo que es leal como un hermano. La sangre pesa mas que el agua pero midela bien, Existe sangre sucia fijate Caín y Abel [CORO:] Porque hay corazones con EN-VI-DIA ! Corazones con IRA ! Corazones con FURIA ! Situaciones de millones corazones Con MIEDO ! Corazones SIN-CEROS ! Corazones GUE-RREROS ! Corazones TRAI-CIO-NEROS ! Soy de la capital del crimen Y en el aire se percibe un espiritu de muerte que devora lo que vive Si fuera por mi reuniria a todos los caserios proponiendo una tregua En nombre de los que se han ido (SIN MIEDO!) Yo les diria mi gente yo solamente aqui soy un valiente que les pide Que no derramen ya la sangre inocente arreglen como hombres Y no se fallen mutuamente, pero se que es un sueño perdido como Ver a los 3 partidos unidos luchando por el bien de Puerto Rico No ven que es mediocre la educacion en los residenciales necesitan Mas maestros necesitan materiales,para crear mas lideres Y menos criminales (Hay corazones alli con problemas personales) Si por mi fuera le daria para atras al tiempo sanaria las heridas Del maltrato de su cuerpo, paraba las manos de aquel centurion Con su lanza Tambien en el acto me tendrian que dar matanza Lo bajaria de la cruz estando moribundo pero tuvo que morir para Salvar al mundo. [CORO:] Porque hay corazones con EN-VI-DIA Corazones con IRA Corazones con FURIA Situaciones de millones corazones Con MIEDO Corazones SIN-CEROS Corazones GUE-RREROS Corazones TRAI-CIO-NEROS Es que en el mundo hay corazones que se creen sabios en su propia opinion, Pero cabe su fin porque andan en caminos de perdicion. Hay corazones que no Perdonan a sus hermanos pero tu sabes que asi mismo Dios no los perdonara Por sus pecados. Hay corazones que ayudan sin pedir nada a cambio y por su Nobleza encuentran el progreso a diario. Hay corazones traicioneros que le gusta Engañar a los corazones sinceros pero mas vale el segundo que el dinero de el Mundo entero. Y existe aquel corazon maligno que nos atormenta como angeles Caidos pero hay un corazon mas poderoso que nos protege que jamas y nunca Sera vencido y el que lo busque y lo encuentre para siempre sera bendecido. Refugiate en salud y vida. Daddy! Situaciones de millones corazones...

En mi barrio  cada gente bale  y tambien todo se bale como tambien el sudor de un padre  por el esfuerzo de traer comida a su casa y pensar que casi siempre se atrasa en dar a su familia alimento  y aunque nunca les pase pasa cuando llega  llega contento  aqui lo que nace  doy fe que aqui se muere una cadena todo enlase donde la traicion no nos vuelve y si con sulavio  un hombre traiciona un secreto el barrio campea con su respeto donde el silencio siempre fiel asu decrepo cumple  por el barrio  por el cual yo vivo  por lo cual prometo  les saluda el gavilan  despertando conciencia  En Barrio Fino  humilde no guillau pero  prefiero morir de pies  que vivir arodillado  Naci en donde la vida me ha echo hombre Acorralado de gente buena E"

Queen,"[Verse 1] It's the sad-eyed goodbye Yesterday moments I remember It's the bleak street Weak-kneed partings I recall  [Pre-Chorus 1] It's the mistier mist, the hazier days The brighter sun and the easier lays  [Chorus 1] There's all the more reason for laughing and crying When you're younger and life isn't too hard at all  [Verse 2] It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays That bored you to rages of tears The unending pleadings to waste all your good times In thoughts of your middle-aged years  [Pre-Chorus 2] It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told For the everyday hero, it all turns to zero  [Chorus 2] And there's all the more reason for living or dying When you're young and your troubles are all very small  [Bridge] Out here on the street, we'd gather and meet And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet And half of the time, we'd broaden our minds more In the pool hall than we did in the school hall With the downtown chewing-gum bums Watching the nightlife, the lights and the fun  [Verse 3] Never wanted to be the boy next door Always thought I'd be something more But it ain’t easy for a smalltown boy It ain’t easy at all  [Outro] Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong It's easier from an armchair Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess  [Spoken Outro] I think I'll be Clint Eastwood Oh no, Jimi Hendrix, he was good Let's try William the Conqueror Now who else do I like? Brian May[Verse 1] I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things We can do the tango, just for two I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings Be a Valentino, just for you  [Chorus] ""Ooh love, Ooh lover boy What're you doing tonight? Hey boy"" Set my alarm, turn on my charm That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy  [Verse 2] Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat (Grow faster, faster) Ooh, can you feel my love heat? (Ohh) Come on and sit on my hot seat of love And tell me how do you feel right after all I'd like for you and I to go romancing Say the word, your wish is my command  [Chorus] “Ooh love, Ooh lover boy What’re you doing tonight? Hey boy” Write my letter, feel much better I’ll use my fancy patter on the telephone  [Bridge] When I'm not with you Think of you always I miss you (I miss those long hot summer nights) When I'm not with you Think of me always Love you, Love you Hey boy where do you get it from? Hey boy where did you go? I learned my passion in the good old fashioned School of lover boys  [Guitar Solo]  [Verse 3] Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 o'clock) precisely I will pay the bill, you taste the wine Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely Just take me back to yours, that will be fine (Come on and get it)  [Chorus] ""Ooh love (There he goes again) Ooh lover boy (Who's my good old-fashioned lover boy? ooh ooh) What're you doing tonight, hey boy"" Everything's all right, just hold on tight That's because I'm a good old-fashioned (Fashioned) lover boy[Verse 1] You might believe in heaven I would not care to say For every star in heaven There's a sad soul here today  Wake up in the morning with a good face Stare at the moon all day Lonely as a whisper on a star chase Does anyone care anyway For all the prayers in heaven So much of life's this way  [Chorus] Did we leave our way behind us Such a long long way behind us Who knows when now who knows where Where the light of day will find us? Look for the day  [Verse 2] Take heart, my friend, we love you Though it seems like you're alone A million lights above you Smile down upon your home  Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase Come let the new child play Lonely as a whisper on a star chase I'm leaving here, I'm long away For all the stars in heaven I would not live, I could not live this way  [Chorus] Did we leave our way behind us Such a long, long way behind us Leave it for some hopeless lane  [Outro] Such a long long way Such a long long way Such a long, long away I'm looking for, looking for that day[Verse 1] When I'm gone No need to wonder if I ever think of you The same moon shines, the same wind blows For both of us, and time is but a paper moon Be not gone  [Verse 2] Though I'm gone It's just as though I hold the flower that touches you A new life grows, the blossom knows There's no one else could warm my heart as much as you Be not gone  [English Chorus] Let us cling together as the years go by Oh my love, my love In the quiet of the night, let our candle always burn Let us never lose the lessons we have learned  [Japanese Chorus] Teo Torriate konomama iko Aisuruhito yo Shizukana yoi ni Hikario tomoshi Itoshiki oshieo idaki  [Verse 3] Hear my song Still, think of me the way you've come to think of me The nights grow long, but dreams live on Just close your pretty eyes and you can be with me Dream on  [Japanese Chorus] Teo Torriate konomama iko Aisuruhito yo Shizukana yoi ni Hikario tomoshi Itoshiki oshieo idaki  [Bridge] When I'm gone They'll say we're all fools and we don't understand Oh, be strong Don't turn your heart We're all, you're all For all, for always  [English Chorus] Let us cling together as the years go by Oh my love, my love In the quiet of the night, let our candle always burn Let us never lose the lessons we have learned[Instrumental intro]  [Verse 1] Bring out the charge of the love brigade There is spring in the air once again Drink to the sound of the song parade There is music and love everywhere Give a little love to me (I want it) Take a little love from me I wanna share it with you  I feel like a millionaire  [Verse 2] Once we were mad, we were happy We spent all our days holding hands together Do you remember, my love? How we danced and played in the rain we laid How we wish that we could stay there, forever and ever  [Verse 3] Now I am sad, you are so far away I sit counting the hours day by day Come back to me, how I long for your love Come back to me, be happy like we used to be  [Guitar solo]  [Bridge] Come back, come back to me Come back, come back to me Oh come back to me, oh my love How I long for your love Won't you come back to me, yeah  [Guitar solo]  [Bridge] My fine friend - take me with you and love me forever My fine friend - forever - forever...

Just the words on your stone A man who learned how to teach Then forgot how to learn Oh yeah...[Verse 1] Music is playing in the darkness And a lantern goes swinging by Shadows flickering, my heart's jittering Just you and I Not tonight, come tomorrow When everything's sunny and bright (sunny and bright) No, no, no, come tomorrow Cause then we'll be waiting for the moonlight  [Chorus] We'll go walking in the moonlight Walking in the moonlight  [Verse 2] Laughter ringing in the darkness People drinking for days gone by Time don't mean a thing when you're by my side Please stay a while You know I never could foresee the future years You know I never could see where life was leading me But will we be together forever? What will be my love, can't you see that I just don't know?

Don't you hear me calling you? Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand In the land that our grandchildren knew  [Instrumental break]  [Verse 2] In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue The volunteers came home that day And they bring good news of a world so newly born Though their hearts so heavily weigh For the Earth is old and grey, little darlin', wellaway But my love, this cannot be For so many years are gone though I'm older but a year Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me [Chorus] Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?

Wow, I'm sick of doubt Live in the light of certain south Cruel bindings The servants have the power Dog-men and their mean women Pulling poor blankets over our sailors I'm sick of dour faces Staring at me from the TV tower I want roses in my garden bower, dig? Royal babies, rubies Must now replace aborted strangers in the mud These mutants, Blood-meal for the plant that's plowed They are waiting to take us Into the severed garden. Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful Comes death on a stranger hour Unannounced, unplanned for Like a scaring over-friendly guest You've brought to bed Death makes angels of us all And gives us wings Where we had shoulders Smooth as raven's claws No more money, no more fancy dress This other kingdom seems by far the best Until its other jaw reveals incest And loose obedience to a vegetable law I will not go Prefer a feast of friends to the giant family  Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment.

The music was new  Black polished chrome  And came over the summer  Like liquid night The DJ's took pills to stay awake  And play for seven days They went to the studio  And someone knew him Someone knew the TV showman. He came to our homeroom party  And played records And when he left in the hot noon sun  And walked to his car We saw the chooks had written  F-U-C-K on his windshield He wiped it off with a white rag  And smiling coolly drove away He's rich, got a big car  Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment.

Awake Shake dreams from your hair, my pretty child, my sweet one Choose the day, choose the sign of your day, the day's divinity, First thing you see. A vast radiant beach and cool jewelled moon Couples naked race down by its quiet side And we laugh like soft, mad children, Smug in the woolly cotton brains of infancy. The music and voices with all around us. Choose, they croon, the ancient ones, the time has come again. Choose now, they croon, beneath the moon, beside an ancient lake. Enter again the sweet forest. Enter the hot dream, come with us. Everything is broken up and dances. Indian scattered on dawn's highway bleeding. Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.  Resident mockery give us an hour for magic We of the purple glove We of the starling flight and velvet hour We of Arabic pleasure's breed We of sun dome and the night Give us a creed to believe a night of lust Give us trust in the night Give of color hundred hues A rich mandala for me and for you And for your silky pillowed house A head, wisdom and a bed Troubled decree resident mockery has claimed thee We used to believe in the good old days We still receive in little ways The things of kindness and unsporting brow Forget and allow  Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment.

I show you good time. This place has everything. C'mon... I show you.  Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind. Blood in the streets in the town of new haven Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of venice Blood in my love in the terrible summer Bloody red sun of phantastic L.A. Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers Blood will be born in the birth if a nation Blood is the rose of mysterious union Blood on the rise, it's following me. Indian, Indian what did you die for? Indian says, nothing at all. Gently they stir, gently rise The dead are newborn awakening With ravaged limbs and wet souls Gently they sigh in rapt funeral amazement Who called these dead to dance? Was it the young woman learning to play the ghost song on her baby grand? Was it the wilderness children? Was it the ghost god himself, stuttering, cheering, chatting blindly? I called you up to anoint the earth I called you to announce sadness falling like burned skin I called you to wish you well To glory in self like a new monster And now I call you to pray  Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment.

Back in those days everything was simpler and more confused One summer night, going to the pier I ran into two young girls The blonde one was called ""Freedom"" The dark one ""Enterprise"" We talked and they told me this story Now listen to this... I'll tell you about Texas radio and the big beat Soft driven, slow and mad Like some new language Reaching your head with the cold, sudden fury of a divine messenger Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god Wandering, wandering in hopeless night Out here in the perimeter there are no stars Out here we is stoned Immaculate.  Thoughts in time and out of season The Hitchhiker stood by the side of the road And leveled his thumb In the calm calculus of reason. Hi. How you doin'? I just got back into town L.A.? I was out on the desert for a while. ""Riders on the storm"" Yeah. Oh. In the middle of it. ""Riders on the storm"" Right... ""Into this world we're born"" Hey, listen, man, I really got a problem ""Into this world we're thrown"" When I was out on the desert, Ya know ""Like a dog without a bone An actor out on loan"" I don't know how to tell you ""Riders on the storm"" But, ah, I killed somebody ""There's a killer on the road"" No... ""His brain is squirming like a toad"" It's no big deal, ya know I don't think anybody will find out about it, ""Take a long holiday"" But just, ah... ""Let your children play"" Ya know, This guy gave me a ride, And I ""If you give this man a ride"" Started giving me a lot of trouble and I just ""Sweet family will die"" Couldn't take it, ya know ""Killer on the road"" Wasted. ""Yeah""  The movie will begin in five moments The mindless voice announced All those unseated will await the next show. We filed slowly, languidly into the hall The auditorium was vast and silent As we seated and were darkened, the voice continued. The program for this evening is not new You've seen this entertainment through and through You've seen your birth your life and death You might recall all of the rest Did you have a good world when you died? Enough to base a movie on? . I'm getting out of here Where are you going? To the other side of morning Please don't chase the clouds, pagodas Her cunt gripped him like a warm, friendly hand. It's all right, all your friends are here When can I meet them? After you've eaten I'm not hungry Uh, we meant beaten Silver stream, silvery scream Ooh, impossible concentration.  A military station in the desert.  Can we resolve the past  Lurking jaws, joints of time?  The Base  To come of age in a dry place  Holes and caves.  My friend drove and hour each day from the mountains  The bus gives you a hard-on with books in your lap  Someone shot the bird in the afternoon dance show  They gave out free records to the best couple  Spades dance best, from the hip.  The world on fire Taxi from Africa The Grand Hotel He was drunk A big party last night Back going back In all directions sleeping these insane hours I'll never wake up in a good mood again I'm sick of these stinky boots  Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment.

Well I heard a story, you can judge it's worth About the sun and the moon the time they came down to earth They pass in the heavens each day up above Time after time they soon became old They could not touch, they could not kiss They had no flesh, no earthly bliss So they made a scheme, they made a plan They would come down to earth as a woman and a man And took human forms to live out a dream The most beautiful people that I've ever seen They were the Peking king and the New York queen I said the Peking king and the New York queen As fate would have it it was a toss of a dice They went to opposite ends of this world with our lives Opposite eyes, opposite minds Such things matter in these troubled times ""We read a book from right to left"" ""You read a book from the left to the right!"" ""We see a rabbit in the moon"" ""When you look at the moon, It's a man on the moon"" ""Raw fish is very tasty, thank you"" ""Eating raw fish is disgusting"" ""Buddha is the only way"" ""Jesus is the fun way"" ""Communism!"" ""Democracy!"" ""East is red"" ""Better dead than red!"" Peking in the east, New York in the west Each say that they are the best About the sun and the moon and their earthly quest Knew without a doubt that it was all the best They said what does it matter how you read a book It's all the same no matter how it looks Well the only thing important to the Peking king Was feeding in the arms of his New York queen Thousands of miles, they were so far apart How to get together, where to start On the California zipper and the Shanghai express He headed to Hong Kong, she headed out west No passports, no visas, no government quotas No red tape no red guard could stop the dream of the Peking king and the New York Queen I said the Peking king and the New York queen So the found a little lot in the field of dreams It was a perfect little place to live our dream East is east, west is west 'Cause you're invited to the wedding to share a dream Of the Peking king and the New York queen Peking king and the New York queen You're invited to the wedding and to share in a dream You're invited to the wedding and to share in a dream Of the Peking king and his New York queen You're invited to the wedding and to share in a dream You're invited to the wedding and to share in a dream Of the sun and the moon Peking king and New York queen  Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment.

All right, now look, look, we've... we've seen a lot of things happened in the city, And everything's turned around. Everything's beautiful. Nobody thought we'd be able to bring the Doors here, and we did. But we've got a couple of thi... Wait a second man! Look, we've just got a couple of little things that we've gotta tell you about. The fire-marshal is not gonna let this show go on, And I just had a long meeting with him, and man, This is no joke, you either gotta sit down, and you gotta go back to your seats, You gotta make isles, and that's it man. You gotta move back. Hey look! Hey look! Wait a second, hold on! Let's have a little help, man. Come on, everybody go back to their seats. People are gonna get hurt up here, They're gonna pass out. Now we don't want that man, and the Doors don't want that either. Ladies and gentlemen, the Doors! Now hold it, we've gotta tune up. Hey Philadelphia! Do you feel all right?  Lions in the street and roaming Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming A beast caged in the heart of a city The body of his mother Rotting in the summer ground. He fled the town. He went down South and crossed the border Left the chaos and disorder Back there over his shoulder. One morning he awoke in a green hotel With a strange creature groaning beside him. Sweat oozed from its shiny skin. Is everybody in? The ceremony is about to begin.  Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment.

We came down The rivers and highways We came down from Forests and falls We came down from Carson and Springfield We came down from Phoenix enthralled And I can tell you The names of the Kingdom I can tell you The things that you know Listening for a fistful of silence Climbing valleys into the shade 'I am the Lizard King I can do anything I can make the earth stop in its tracks I made the blue cars go away  Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment.

Way back deep into the brain Way back past the realm of pain Back where there's never any rain. And the rain falls gently on the town, And over the heads of all of us. And in the labyrinth of streams Beneath, quiet unearthly presence of Nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around, Reptiles abounding Fossils, caves, cool air heights. Each house repeats a mold Windows rolled A beast car locked in against morning. All now sleeping Rugs silent, mirrors vacant, Dust blind under the beds of lawful couples Wound in sheets. And daughters, smug With semen eyes in their nipples Wait There's been a slaughter here!  For seven years I dwelt In the loose palace of exile, Playing strange games With the girls of the island. Now I have come again To the land of the fair, and the strong, and the wise. Brothers and sisters of the pale forest Children of night Who among you will run with the hunt?  Now night arrives with her purple legion. Retire now to your tents and to your dreams. Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth. I want to be ready. The doors! the doors! We're out of time, thank you very much. we're out of time. All right, we've got time for one more, let's do it one more time.  I was doing time In the universal mind I was feeling fine I was turning keys I was setting people free I was doing all right Then you came along With a suitcase and a song Turned my head around Now I'm so alone Just looking for a home In every place I see I'm the freedom man I'm the freedom man I'm the freedom man That's how lucky I am I was doing time In the universal mind I was feeling fine I was turning keys I was setting people free I was doing all right Then you came along With a suitcase and a song Turned my head around Now I'm so alone Just looking for a home In every place I see I'm the freedom man I was doing time In the universal mind I was feeling fine I was turning keys I was setting people free I was doing all right Then you came along With a suitcase and a song Turned my head around Now I'm so alone Just looking for a home In every place I see I'm the freedom man Yeah, that's how lucky I am I'm the freedom man I'm the freedom man  Wake up! You can't remember where it was. Had this dream stopped? The snake was pale gold Glazed and shrunken. We were afraid to touch it. The sheets were hot dead prisons. And she was beside me. Old, she's numb. Her dark, red hair, The white soft skin. Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom, Look! She's coming in here I can't live through each slow century of her moving. I let my cheek slide down The cool smooth tile Feel the good cold stinging blood The smooth hissing snakes of rain...  Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah I walked 47 miles on barbed-wire, Cobra-snake for a necktie. Built a house by the roadside, Made of rattlesnake hide. Brand new chimney up on top, Made out of human skulls. Come on baby take a walk with me, Tell me who do you love? Who do you love, now? Who do you love, now? Who do you love, babe? I say: who now, who do you love? Tombstone head and a graveyard mind, Just 22 and I don't mind dying. Rode around the town with a rattlesnake whip, Come on baby don't give me no lip. Who do you love, now? Who do you love? Who do you love, child? I said: who, baby, who do you love? Night is dark, the sky was blue, Down the alley the ice wagon flew. Hit a bump, somebody screamed, You should have heard just what I seen. Do you love me, babe? Do you love her, yeah Do you love me, babe? Do you love it, yeah Yeah Well, who, baby, who do you love? What do you love, now? Love, love, love me babe. Love, love, love me darling.
